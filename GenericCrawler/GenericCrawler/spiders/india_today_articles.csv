He said some Nepalese leaders were also involved in the game.Also watch | KP Oli accuses India of trying to topple Nepal govtAccusing the southern neighbour and leaders of his own party by the Prime Minister was not appropriate, a senior leader of the party quoted Prachanda as saying during the meeting.Prachanda told Oli that it was not India but him who had been seeking his resignation both as party chair and prime minister, the NCP leader said.Besides Prachanda, senior leaders Madhav Kumar Nepal, Jhalanath Khanal, Bamdev Gautam and Narayankaji Shrestha also asked Prime Minister Oli to provide evidence of his accusation and asked to quit the power, he said.What the Prime Minister spoke was objectionable and inappropriate, they said. They also asked the Prime Minister to name the leaders who were behind the conspiracy to remove him.They said the Prime Minister should resign on moral grounds as he spoke such ""undiplomatic and nonpolitical remarks."" However, the Prime Minister who was also present at the meeting, did not make any comment.""It shows that the Prime Minister was reduced to a minority both in the 48-member Standing Committee and nine-member Central Secretariat,"" the senior leader of the NCP party said.Prachanda has time and again spoken about the lack of coordination between the government and the party and he was pressing for a one-man one position system to be followed by the NCP.Also Read | Amid dispute with India, demands of Nepal PM KP Oli’s resignation grows within party""I did not commit any mistake by claiming our land, which has been snatched from us for the past 58 years after Nepal enjoyed the rights over these areas for 146 years,"" Oli said on Sunday.Nepal this month completed the process of redrawing the country's political map through a Constitutional amendment, incorporating Lipulekh, Kalapani and Limpiyadhura areas which India maintains belong to it.India has termed as ""untenable"" the ""artificial enlargement"" of the territorial claims by Nepal.The India-Nepal bilateral ties came under strain after Defence Minister Rajnath Singh inaugurated a 80-km-long strategically crucial road connecting the Lipulekh pass with Dharchula in Uttarakhand on May 8.Nepal reacted sharply to the inauguration of the road claiming that it passed through Nepalese territory. India rejected the claim asserting that the road lies completely within its territory.""In the past when I signed trade agreements with Beijing, my minority government collapsed. But this time we have a government with a full-fledged majority, so no one can remove me now,” Oli, known for his pro-China leanings, said on Sunday.In July 2016, Oli had resigned as prime minister just before a no-confidence vote after the Maoists withdrew support from the coalition government. At the time, he had termed the no-trust motion as a conspiracy by ""foreign elements"" to turn the country into a ""laboratory"" and obstruct the implementation of the new Constitution.Earlier in April this year, Oli was asked to resign from the post.Prime Minister Oli was facing strong criticism from his own colleagues for the government's non-performance and lack of coordination between the party and the government.

Considered one of the best finishers of the game, Hussey said he admires the calm and calculated approach to the game from Dhoni.Dhoni has not played competitive cricket since India's semi-final exit at World Cup 2019. Even as speculations are rife about his international future, Dhoni has kept mum about it. The CSK captain geared up for Indian Premier League (IPL) 2020 as he trained with his mates in Chennai before the season was suspended due to the novel coronavirus pandemic.""He's been an incredible person and player for CSK and India for so long. We hope he keeps playing for another 10 years but I am not sure we are going to be able to see that. Hopefully, he can play for as long as he can,"" Hussey said during an online interaction for Sony Ten Pit Stop.""I love MS as the captain. I love how calm he is and how much he backs his players and shows so much faith in his players. Obviously he is very astute from a tactical point of view.

The brand’s first Find came to India in 2014 and had an amazing response in the market. OPPO further redefined smartphone performance in 2018 with the launch of Find X which took the Indian market by storm. And now it has set itself even further apart from the competition by taking the experience of the Find X users to the next level with its latest flagship smart device, the OPPO Find X2.What sets the Find X2 apart from all other premium flagship smartphones in the market is the world’s first commercialized and fastest 65W SuperVOOC 2.0 charging technology. With a powerful companion like that, who would want anything else? And that’s not all. The OPPO Find X2 offers a host of other premium features at a price point that will make you fall in love with it. Let’s dig in. Charging speed that will beat even the bestOPPO has been all about technological innovations, which is visible in their every smartphone launch. Year after year, the company’s R&D efforts have brought consumers the best of the tech world, and one of those is OPPO’s proprietary SuperVOOC Flash Charge. Introduced first in the Find X smartphone, the charging tech has become even better in the new OPPO Find X2.The Find X2 is backed by the world’s first commercialized and fastest 65W SuperVOOC 2.0 charging technology, which can fully charge the phone in just 38 minutes. Users can use their phones all day, without any concern about battery life because they can recharge literally in minutes. Plus, the phone comes with a large 4200 mAh battery.And all of this super-fast charging happens without compromising on safety. SuperVOOC 2.0 continues the VOOC security feature with five levels of security protection from the power adapter, wire, and handset. Special thanks to the multiple cooling technology and TÜV Rheinland Certified Safe Fast-Charge System, the phone will never heat up even when you are charging and using it at the same time. So, you can be assured of a solid, non-stop flagship experience. OPPO’s most powerful and colorful screen EVERThe fact that the OPPO Find X2 Series is in a league of its own becomes evident from the moment you switch on the phone. That is because it comes with the most colorful and powerful screen ever introduced by the brand - a 120 Hz Ultra Vision Screen that comes with 6.7-inch curved 10-bit OLED display with a quad HD+ (1440 x 3168) resolution. It also has a staggering refresh rate of 120 Hz, which means games, apps and videos will flow smoothly across it and scrolling will never be a strain. Unlike other phones where high refresh rates are accompanied by high battery usage, the Find X2 actually can change the refresh rate to suit your usage scenario, and can adjust accordingly - it can deliver a higher refresh rate if you are scrolling, for instance, and revert to a more routine one if you are doing something that does need a high refresh rate. This ensures that power consumption is optimized during screen usage.The display also boasts of accurate color reproduction matching professional level displays, supports over one billion kinds of color displays, making it one of the most richly colored displays you will see on a mobile phone. Thanks to a brightness range of 500 to 800 nits, it will be readable even in the bright afternoon sun. Never too bright to hurt, though, as it can automatically adjust the screen color to match the right conditions around you providing a more comfortable movie viewing experience on Netflix. Not only this, the high-quality screen has been well received in the industry and has also got A+ score from DisplayMate and an Eye Comfort certification from TÜV Rheinland.  Hardware and design to redefine flagshipsEnsuring all this works smoothly requires a lot of power. And the OPPO Find X2 comes with a Qualcomm Snapdragon 865 processor, which is easily the fastest processor you can find on an Android flagship! This combined with up to 12 GB RAM, and 256 GB of storage ensures that the phone always performs at an impressive rate and provides users an ample storage option. Another factor in the smooth running of the phone is the presence of Color OS 7.1, which not only adds a number of features to Android 10, but also ensures smoother software and hardware optimization.The Find X2 is also 5G optimized which means that it is effectively future proof in every sense.Not just performance, the OPPO Find X2 gets full marks in the design department too. The overall look and feel of the device is, in every sense, true flagship level. The OPPO Find X2 comes in ceramic and glass back in Black and Ocean colors and is a delight to the eye. The phone itself is IP54 water and dust resistant and at a mere 8 mm in thickness, will slip into most pockets easily. Not that too many would want to keep it there. With its curved glass display and beautiful frame, the OPPO Find X2 belongs in the limelight rather than in a pocket or a bag. Some serious camera muscleThis being an OPPO’s flagship, comes with best-in-class cameras. The Find X2 features a 48MP main camera, a 12MP 120° ultra-wide sensor and a 13MP telephoto camera with 5x hybrid optical zoom, and up to 20x digital zoom. That’s a whole lot of megapixels of shooting power right on the back of the phone - OPPO calls it the Ultra Vision Camera System. And it delivers stunning images and videos, irrespective of the light conditions.It is not just about specs and hardware, but the unmatched performance and top-notch innovations, especially in the charging department, that will change your expectations from a smartphone forever. The device is available on Amazon at Rs 64,999.With its superior charging technology, design, display, cameras, topped off with super hardware and software integration the Find X2 can indulge the most demanding of users, which makes it THE best android flagship smart device of 2020."

The Americas was the hardest-hit region, losing 18.3% of working hours.Worldwide, an estimated 14% of working hours were lost in the second quarter, equivalent to 400 million full-time jobs, due to the pandemic, the ILO said.It estimated that working-hour losses were likely to still be in the order of 4.9 per cent in the fourth quarter, equivalent to 140 million full-time jobs. Under a pessimistic scenario in a so-called second wave of the pandemic, this figure could rise to 11.9% or 340 million jobs, it said.""The estimates have revised upwards considerably the damage done to our labour markets by the pandemic,"" Guy Ryder, ILO director-general, told a Geneva news conference. ""So there is not going to be a simple or a quick recovery.""The figures cover people who are working shorter hours, who are furloughed, have lost their jobs, or withdrawn from the labour force.They reflect ""worsening conditions"", especially in developing countries, the report said.Some 93 per cent of workers still live in countries with some sort of workplace closures, it said.The pandemic has had a ""disproportionate and damaging effect"" on women workers, who are often employed in hard-hit sectors such as food and accommodation, retail and real estate, Ryder said.Asked about Brazil not imposing strict public health measures to halt spread of coronavirus, Ryder said: ""Clearly undue delay in acting on the health side of pandemic is going to bring worse social and economic outcomes.""""It is inevitable...that the world is going to begin to emerge from this pandemic with higher levels of unemployment, higher levels of poverty, higher levels of inequality, higher levels of frustration among citizens, but also higher levels of indebtedness,"" he said.ALSO READ | Far from over: Coronavirus pandemic speeding up, worse yet to come, warns WHOÄLSO WATCH | Trump blames China for coronavirus pandemic"

While he mentioned the Atmanirbhar Bharat Abhiyan, there was no Sabre rattling.PM MODI EXTENDS FREE RATION SCHEMEAnnouncing the extension of the free foodgrain scheme for the needy till November, PM Modi said, “July marks the beginning of the festive season which increases necessities as well as expenditure. Keeping all these things in mind, it has been decided to extend the Pradhan Mantri Garib Kalyan Anna Yojana up to Diwali and Chhath Puja i.e. till November-end.”He added,” The government will provide free ration to 80 crore poor brothers and sisters for five months. Every member of the family will get five kilograms of wheat or rice. Also, every family will get one-kilogram whole chana dal per month, free of cost. Rs 90,000 crore will be spent on this extension. If we add expenditure of the past three months on this scheme, then it comes to around Rs 1.5 lakh crore.""The move according to the government will add a layer of economic security for jobless migrants and the poor who are enlisting under the MGNREGA scheme or those migrants who are heading back to economic centres but are yet to get a job.The free foodgrain under the PMGKAY will be over and above the five kilograms of grain per month under the NFSA scheme. PM Modi emphasised that the number of people who would benefit from the announcements is over 2.5 times the population of the United States and 12 times the population of the United Kingdom.To keep the large middle-class segment and farmers engaged he also said, ""If the government is able to provide free ration to the needy and poor, then credit for it goes to two categories. One, the hard-working farmers of our country. Second, the honest taxpayers of our country.”OPPOSITION SAYS ADDRESS HAD NO SUBSTANCEOn the other hand, the opposition wanted the prime minister to put on record facts on the stand-off with China. “The prime minister is too afraid to talk about China in his national address,” charged the Congress after the speech.Targeting PM Modi, the Congress on Tuesday said his address lacked substance and could just “have been another government notification”.Congress leader Rahul Gandhi took a jibe at the prime minister with an Urdu couplet -- ""Tu idhar udhar ki na baat kar, ye bataa ki kaafila kaise lutaa"" -- for not mentioning China in his address.Congress spokesperson Supriya Shrinate accused PM Modi of doing headline management and said Modi did not look the ""enemy"" in the eye, which was expected of him after a bloody standoff with China in Ladakh on June 15.""Our biggest expectation was that the PM will gather the courage and the will to look at China in the eye and reply to the enemy. Take the enemy head-on and make a very strong statement against what China is doing. But the PM once again shied away,"" she said.Bowing to people's protests, the Modi government has extended the provision of 5 kg grains free for 80 crore people for the next five months. This falls far short of the required 10 kg per month for 6 months to all needy to prevent hunger deaths,"" CPI(M) general secretary Sitaram Yechury said.West Bengal MP and All India Trinamool Congress leader Mahua Moitra also criticised Prime Minister Narendra Modi's 16-minute long speech, saying that he 'walked around the Panda in the room' and did not talk about anything useful.PM MODI DANGLES BIHAR ELECTIONS BAITBut the prime minister did offer a political bait. He in his speech listed the festivals that fall between July and November. He said, ”July 5 is Guru Purnima, then the month of Saawan is starting. Then August 15 is coming, Raksha Bandhan, Sri Krishna Janmashtami, Ganesh Chaturthi and Onam will follow. Further, Kati Bihu, Navratri, Durga Puja is coming, then Dussera, Diwali and Chhath Puja.”The introduction of Chhath festival was a deliberate subtle addition that underlined that the extension of the free foodgrain scheme was a signal to over 50 lakh migrant workers, who pushed by the lack of jobs and Covid-19 fears, had undertaken long and arduous journeys back to their native places in Bihar.Bihar goes to elections later this year and the BJP has received reports from the ground about migrant workers’ displeasure over the Centre and Bihar government’s failure to mitigate the crisis they faced.Then his list of festivals also pushed leaders like Asaduddin Owaisi of the AIMIM to charge that the prime minister deliberately didn’t mention Eid-ul-Adha, a Muslim festival in late July.The prime minister's mention of the 'One Nation, One Ration Card’ scheme which will make a ration card eligible anywhere in the country also came under fire.Congress spokesperson Adil Singh Boparai told India Today TV, ""The government has announced this scheme four times in the last three months. What’s the point of the PM mentioning a scheme which is not ready in his address to the nation?”WHY DID THE GOVT EXTEND THE FREE RATION SCHEME? While the government hopes that the free food grain scheme may make good politics, it does also make good economic sense.India currently is sitting on top of a huge stockpile of foodgrains.The nation’s granaries on the first day of June this year had about 100 million tonnes of food grain. With the Kharif crop flowing in large quantities, the government is short of space to store the essentials.Only 40 million tonnes need to be kept as buffer stock as per government guidelines, so the redistribution of foodgrains to the needy allows the produce to be utilised optimally.READ | PM Modi Speech Highlights: Free ration for poor till November, coronavirus vigilance must, says PMREAD | Free foodgrains for 80 crore poor extended till November: PM Narendra ModiWATCH | PM Modi extends free ration for poor till November; Unlock 2.0 guidelines"
https://www.indiatoday.in/india/story/did-pm-modi-just-sound-bugle-for-bihar-election-1695704-2020-07-01,2020-07-01 10:36:00,Why PM Modi talked about Chhath Puja in June,"Prime Minister Narendra Modi announced extension of PM Garib Kalyan Anna Yojana “till Chhath Puja or end of November”. The term of the current Bihar assembly expires on November 29. And, only recently, Chief Election Commissioner Sunil Arora said in an interview that there was “no plan to defer Bihar election”.So, did PM Modi just announce Bihar Assembly election? Else, extension of a foodgrain scheme could have been announced through a press release. (A little diversion, at least West Bengal Chief Minister and TMC boss Mamata Banerjee does believe so. She has extended the scheme for free foodgrain till June 2021. Assembly’s tenure ends in May 2021)Just a day ago, the government put out a release to enforce ban on 59 Chinese apps and another for Unlock 2.0. To be fair, PM Modi spoke about reopening measures expressing concerns about people becoming “careless” with Unlock 1.0.Bihar is facing one of the severest life and livelihood issues in the wake of coronavirus pandemic. Bihar is estimated to have received the highest number of returnees in reverse migration.There is no concrete figure for returning migrants in Bihar but the official estimate is 23-24 lakh workers for whom the government has promised employment under new PM Garib Kalyna Rozgar Abhiyan.The Centre has mapped 67 lakh returning migrant workers as potential beneficiaries and selected 116 districts for the employment scheme across six states.Of these 32 are in Bihar, which has a total of 38 districts. During the coronavirus lockdown, it was the migrant workers from Bihar which hit the maximum new headlines building a perception that a large number of poor in the state would be angry with the government.Besides the Modi government at the Centre, the BJP is in power in Bihar also in alliance with Chief Minister Nitish Kumar’s Janata Dal-United. In a recent interaction with PM Modi, CM Nitish is understood to have underscored his challenge of handling the reverse migration crisis in Bihar, which has seen surge in Covid-19 cases over last few weeks.Officials in the Bihar have reported to the Nitish Kumar government that a large number of returning migrants are “not in a mood” to go back to places they worked earlier. Bihar has one of the highest population densities and worse employment rates.Against this background, PM Modi in a special nationally televised address said this: “With the onset of July comes the time of festivalsThis time of festivals expands our needs and increases our expenditure. Keeping this in mind, it has been decided that PM Garib Kalyan Anna Yojana will extended till Diwali and Chhath (a festival identified with Bihar), that is, till the end of November.”In the same address, PM Modi said this scheme has ensured food to 80 crore people more than double the population of the US and 12 times that of the UK during coronavirus lockdown. He emphasised that extension of the scheme till the end of November would cost the government an additional Rs 90,000 crore.Its extension till November makes it cover the politically fragile issue of livelihood of millions of people in Bihar until assembly election is over.At the ground zero, while Bihar continues to battle with Covid-19, the local administration has begun the booth-level administrative election work. For example, in the capital district of Patna, polling booths are being reorganised according to the electoral rolls updated in January this year.Under the new booth rationalisation process, it is being ensured that no polling station should have more than 1,000 voters for effective management of assembly election. The fact that the administrative process for assembly election has begun corroborates ECE Sunil Arora’s assessment that the Bihar Assembly polls may not need to be deferred.In an interview to the Economic Times in mid-June, Sunil Arora said, “At the moment, no plan is being considered to defer Bihar elections.”Some political commentators say Bihar Assembly election is more important to PM Modi than CM Nitish Kumar linking it with the Modi government’s pro-poor narrative. This is why Bihar has been the political flavour of coronavirus season.Earlier paying tribute to soldiers of Bihar Regiment who sacrificed their lives in Galwan clash, PM Modi said, “Today when I am speaking to people of Bihar, I will say the valour was of Bihar Regiment, every Bihari is proud of it.”Though it is known most soldiers of the Bihar Regiment are not recruited from Bihar. Colonel Santosh Babu, who led the verification team that was attached in a premeditated fashion by the Chinese troops in Galwan was from Telangana.Again, when PM Modi launched Garib Kalyan Rozgar Abhiyan for returning migrant workers, he did it in Bihar in on June 20. It was a virtual launch. Interestingly, this employment scheme is for 125 days only, and will expire in late October. Anna Yojana, however, ends on November 30.Previously, Union Home Minister Amit Shah began his interaction series with booth-level BJP workers from Bihar. The BJP put in its wherewithal to relay this virtual rally to 72,000 booth-level gatherings.Before this, BJP reconstituted its state unit’s executive body giving place to almost every leader of significance in Bihar. There are 358 members on this body.The state is already witnessing political movement from one party to another. In an important coat-turning incident, five sitting MLCs of the principal Opposition party, the RJD recently joined the JDU. The Lok Janshakti Party is the third constituent in the ruling NDA in Bihar.Delhi and Bihar were the two states in 2015 that had shocked the BJP in assembly elections. Arvind Kejriwal-powered Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) had won 67 of 70 seats in Delhi.In Bihar Nitish Kumar buried his differences with RJD chief Lalu Prasad to forge Mahagathbandhan the grand alliance with the Congress as third constituent and cause of rout of the BJP. The grand alliance won 178 and the NDA just 57 in the 243-member assembly.In 2020 polls, Kejriwal and his AAP kept the BJP at bay in Delhi. Bihar is BJP’s final frontier to battle for this year.READ | From keeping quiet on China to mentioning Chhath: The politics of PM Modi's speech decodedALSO READ | Small parties in big trouble ahead of Bihar pollsALSO WATCH | Is PM Modi trying to revive pro-poor image?"

""We cannot and will not allow the Chinese Communist Party to exploit network vulnerabilities and compromise our critical communications infrastructure,"" FCC Chairman Ajit Pai said in a statement Tuesday.Huawei and ZTE did not immediately respond to requests for comment but have previously sharply criticized the FCC's actions.FCC Commissioner Geoffrey Starks said on Tuesday that ""untrustworthy equipment"" remains in place in U.S. networks and said the U.S. Congress must allocate funding for replacements.In May 2019, Trump signed an executive order declaring a national emergency and barring U.S. companies from using telecommunications equipment made by companies posing a national security risk. The Trump administration also added Huawei to its trade blacklist last year.The FCC has taken an increasingly hard line against Chinese firms.In April, the FCC said it may shut down U.S. operations of three state-controlled Chinese telecommunications companiesThe FCC required China Telecom Americas, China Unicom Americas, Pacific Networks Corp and its wholly owned subsidiary ComNet (USA) LLC to explain why it should not start the process of revoking authorizations enabling their U.S. operations.The FCC granted its approvals to the firms more than a decade ago.In May 2019, the FCC voted to deny another state-owned Chinese telecommunications company, China Mobile Ltd, the right to provide U.S. services, citing risks that the Chinese government could use the company to conduct espionage against the U.S. government.ALSO READ | Govt bans 59 Chinese apps including TikTok as border tensions simmer in LadakhALSO READ | TikTok, Mi Community, Shareit, other 56 Chinese apps banned in India: What happens if you have them on phoneALSO READ | Full list of Chinese apps banned in India today: TikTok and 58 other appsALSO WATCH | India bans 59 Chinese apps including Tik Tok"

They felt India is stabbing China on the back...that India is putting China in an impossible position where either China responds aggressively and be seen as attacking India, or does nothing and actually end up losing territory,"" Yun Sun said, adding that understanding the Chinese motivation behind the recent moves is not very hard.She said while the English media in China may not have sufficient text to give an idea of the Chinese thinking over the present situation, but there is an abundance of information on China's strategy and motivation that is available in the Chinese language media.Asked about the timing of the recent aggression, Yun Sun said while border disputes between the two countries have been on for years, the year 2020 is of special importance for China because of the internal pressures and the perceived external attacks on it over the coronavirus pandemic.""The power competition between India and China in Asia gives rise to conflicts and affects regional power balance,"" she said.SOURCE OF BORDER CONFLICTSSpeaking about the nature of border conflicts between India and China, Yun Sun said the situation at present is that both the countries are trying to address their security concerns by deploying forces into the region and building infrastructure.""Both sides think what they are doing is to protect their national security and their national interest. But in effect, what they are undertaking as their respective exercises in capacity enhancement, is perceived as an aggression by the other side. This is because enhancement of security on one side automatically translates into decrease of security on the other side,"" Yun Sun said.In terms of military activities, both sides react to ""what they believe"" the other side is doing, she said.'China's biggest threat is US; India's is China'Responding to the theory that China is intentionally becoming aggressive during the time of a global pandemic to assert itself at the international stage by attacking India (its main competitor in Asia), Yun Sun said people who forward this theory must realise that for China, the threat is on its Eastern border (East and South China Sea) and not on the Western Border (with India).""From the Chinese perspective, its main security concern is not in the West, but in the East. The US is identified as China's greatest military threat. Why would China then want to start a two-front war with India in the west and US in the east? That is not something in China's national interest in any sense,"" Yun Sun said.She added that while India is not China's biggest security threat, ""for India, China is its biggest threat"".""China would like to have friendly relations with India, especially in context of the US trying to come closer to India and persuade it to get involved in the South China Sea. But if the Chinese perceive that India is trying to leverage its alliance with US to force China to abandon its territorial claims, then that is not something that it would ever entertain,"" Yun Sun said.Adding further, she said that while China would want to have good relations with India, it will not be at the cost of sacrificing its territorial integrity.""Good bilateral relation with India is a means to an end i.e. to defend its national interest. Good bilateral relations in itself is not an end. If China has to sacrifice its territorial integrity for the sake of good relations with India, then having good relations fails the purpose,"" she said.WHAT NEXT?Asked about where the present situation is heading towards and if there is a possible way out, Yun Sun said at the moment it is clear that both sides are imitating each other in terms of enhancing border infrastructure and defence capabilities.""If India is building a road in Daulat Beg Oldie, then China sees it as a security vulnerability and would want to build a road in its area. Similarly, when China builds up something in the area, then India will perceive it as a strategic weakness and would want to build something similar.""Advocating for a diplomatic solution to the present situation, Yun Sun said, ""What is happening at Pangong Tso Lake has happened in the past too. I think diplomats of both sides are negotiating on a path for de-escalation. But the top leaderships of the two countries will have to come forward so that the troops on ground act in line with the diplomatic talks.""

For the past 10 days, more than 12,800 cases have been reported in India every day. On June 28, India saw its highest single-day spike with 19,906 new cases being reported. Thirty-five of the country's 36 states and Union Territories have reported Covid-19 cases so far. Only Lakshadweep has not reported any case so far.However, despite all this, the central government continues to maintain that community transmission has yet not taken place in India.According to the latest data put out by the Union health ministry, as of 8 am on June 30, the number of Covid-19 cases in India was 5,66,840, of which 3,34,822 have recovered and 16,893 have died so far.Among states, Maharashtra, Gujarat, Delhi, Tamil Nadu, Madhya Pradesh and Rajasthan are the hotspots for Covid-19 cases. Maharashtra and Gujarat have also reported the highest number of Covid-19 deaths, accounting for nearly 60 per cent of the country's Covid-19 toll.The scale of this health emergency is such that a country inhabited by nearly 1.3 billion people has been under a lockdown since March 25. This is by far the biggest lockdown in the world.The rise of novel coronavirus cases in India can be better understood from the fact that as on March 10 India had just 50 Covid-19 cases. On March 20, this increased to 196 cases; by March 25 to 606 cases and by the end of the month (March 31) India had 1,397 confirmed Covid-19 cases.As on April 18, government figures showed that 14,792 people had tested positive for Covid-19 in India. By May 6, this rose to 49,391, and crossed the 56,000 mark as of May 8. By May 23, this figure stood at 1,25,101 cases.This health emergency has put immense pressure on the country's healthcare system and the economy has been severely disrupted. The International Monetary Fund has predicted that India's GDP growth for 2020-21 will fall to 1.9 per cent, while the global economy is expected to suffer a loss of $9 trillion.To help explain the scale of the coronavirus outbreak in India, IndiaToday.in is regularly analysing key data and trends related to this health emergency. We bring to you this in-depth analysis and a daily tracker on Covid-19 cases in India.(Figures and charts used in this report are updated daily and are based on the data displayed on the website of the Union Ministry of Health and Family Welfare. Individual state governments may have different numbers. (Read footnote for details on our methodology.))Coronavirus cases: The national pictureThe geographical spread of coronavirus outbreak in India has now extended to 35 states and Union Territories with Sikkim being the latest to report a Covid-19 case.The first Covid-19 case in India was reported on January 30 in Kerala's Thrissur district. The patient, a student studying in Wuhan, China (the epicentre of the novel coronavirus pandemic), had returned home on account of the Lunar New Year festivities in China.In a span of four days, two other cases were reported in Kerala--in Kasaragod and Alappuzha districts--prompting the state government to declare a state-level emergency on February 3. These two patients were also students who had returned from China.Following detection, the three patients were immediately put in isolation at state medical facilities and over 3,400 people who were suspected to have come in their contact were quarantined and observed for novel coronavirus-related symptoms. Days later, the three patients were discharged upon recovery.How Covid-19 cases are rising in IndiaAs mentioned above, the first Covid-19 case in India was reported on January 30 in Kerala's Thrissur district and by February 3, India had three confirmed Covid-19 cases.India did not see any new case for nearly a month, until March 2 when two positive cases were reported, one each in Delhi and Hyderabad. Both the patients had a travel history to countries already affected by the novel coronavirus pandemic.The graph below shows the trend that Covid-19 cases have followed in India.Good news! People are recovering tooWhile the number of new Covid-19 cases in India have been rising rapidly with tens of new cases being reported, there is also some positive news.Some of the patients who were admitted and put in isolation after they tested positive for Covid-19, have recovered and been discharged.The first three cases in India were reported in Kerala between January 30 and February 3 and were put under isolation. However, later in February they recovered and were discharged.Since then, more patients have recovered in India.India's first 50 Covid-19 casesWhile most patients in India have had a travel history to countries that have reported a high number of Covid-19 cases, of late there have also been many cases where local transmission (i.e. people contracting the disease in India) has been reported.IndiaToday.in had earlier analysed travel histories of the first 50 Covid-19 patients in India. Our analysis showed that 39 of them had a travel history to a country that was already affected by the coronavirus outbreak. The remaining 11 contracted the disease through local transmission in India.These first 50 Covid-19 cases were reported from: Kerala, Tamil Nadu, Telangana, Karnataka, Maharashtra, Uttar Pradesh, Delhi, Haryana, Rajasthan, Punjab, J&K and Ladakh.The global pictureThe interactive dashboard below has been prepared by the World Health Organisation and monitors Covid-19 cases on a daily basis. You can explore the dashboard to find global trends and developments in regards to the coronavius pandemic.(NOTES ON METHODOLOGY:How we collect data?The figures used in this report are based on the numbers put out by the Union Ministry of Health and Family Welfare. The ministry collects data from individual states and keeps updating the tally on its website multiple times in a day. But since there is no fixed time when these numbers are updated, we don't update our numbers throughout the day. Instead, we take the numbers that are available on the ministry's website at 11.59pm every day. Besides this, at times the ministry's website releases an overall figure with a note saying state-wise details are awaited. For our report, we DO NOT take the overall figure unless it matches with the state-wise breakup.*Since May 6, the Union Health Ministry has decided to issue only one daily bulletin on Covid-19. It is released at 8 am every day.Any limitations in this?While this method helps us track Covid-19 cases in an ordered manner with state wise numbers for each date, it has certain limitations. Unlike the World Health Organisation that releases a daily situation report, the Union Ministry of Health and Family Welfare doesn't.Besides this, it is possible that a case that was declared positive by a state government on Monday, was not reflected in the central government's numbers for that day because there was a delay in the state submitting its report to the Centre. (There have been such instances. Example: The first case in West Bengal was reflected in the Centre's list one day after the state government announced it.)In such cases, the case would be reflected in the Centre's list on the next day (i.e. Tuesday, a day after it was actually detected). For the sake of uniformity, in this report we are strictly following the numbers put out by the central government. However, despite this limitation (in terms of occasional delayed reporting), the methodology we have adopted ensures all cases that have been detected are added in our figures.Read more from Mukesh Rawat's archive, follow him on Twitter or subscribe to his updates on Facebook.ALSO READ | Coronavirus outbreak and mental health: How we can help people in quarantineALSO READ | Coronavirus in India: Tracking country's first 50 COVID-19 cases; what numbers tellALSO READ | Coronavirus: From Covid-19 to pandemic, some key terms explainedALSO WATCH | India fights coronavirus: Here's all you need to know"

Coronavirus in India is less virulent than in the rest of the world?Watch: Coronavirus FAQs | Part 1Who should get tested for novel coronavirus?Dr Guleria: Even if you have a fever and a severe cough, or a sore throat, you still need not get tested as of now unless you fit in two criteria. The first criteria are whether you have travelled abroad in the last 14 days, especially to a country where an outbreak of novel coronavirus is happening or you have come in close contact with a laboratory-confirmed case of Covid-19.How long does it take for symptoms to appear?Dr Guleria: This is what we call the incubation period. It usually takes between 2-7 days but it varies up to 14 days. Rarely, it has been reported that sometimes it can take even longer but in most patients, within 5-7 days symptoms will start to appear in the form of fever, cough and sore throat.Should everyone be wearing masks?Dr Guleria: Everyone need not wear a mask. It is important to understand that if you have a cough and cold, you should wear a mask so that you don't transmit the infection to others. If you are a healthcare worker looking after patients, it's worthwhile to wear a mask. Otherwise, a common person going out for day-to-day work or is at home or even going out for some time need not wear a mask, it does not protect you. Sometimes it can be harmful because you might end up touching your face to re-adjust the mask and end up transmitting disease from an infected surface on to your face using your hands.Editor's note: Dr Guleria's answer on wearing masks is from a Q&A session conducted before countries started modifying their advisories on masks. Based on evidence that masks can stop an asymptomatic carrier of Covid-19 from unwittingly spreading the virus, several countries including India are now recommending or even mandating that people wear homemade masks or face covers while stepping out of their homes. This would, theoretically, help reduce the risk of large-scale outbreaks of the novel coronavirus. The fact remains that there is not much scientific evidence that masks protect the wearer from the novel coronavirus.Should those with asthma wear a mask?Dr Guleria: Those with asthma need not necessarily wear masks. However, they need to wash their hands regularly and maintain social distancing apart from avoiding crowded places.Editor's note: Dr Guleria's answer on wearing masks is from a Q&A session conducted before countries started modifying their advisories on masks.

This would, theoretically, help reduce the risk of large-scale outbreaks of the novel coronavirus. The fact remains that there is not much scientific evidence that masks protect the wearer from the novel coronavirus.If a colleague gets infected, what should be done?Dr Guleria: If you have come in contact who is infected, it is important to start the process of self-quarantine because you could get the infection or end up transmitting it.Editor's note: The Ministry of Health and Family Welfare has urged anyone who has knowledge of prior contact with a confirmed Covid-19 patient to come forward and inform local healthcare authorities as a precaution.Is it safe to visit hospitals with Covid-19 patients?Dr Guleria: It's safe to visit hospitals because patients infected with novel coronavirus are being kept in isolation wards. However, one must not visit the hospital at this time unless it is absolutely necessary. Routine healthcare visits should be postponed.Will summer or humidity kill the novel coronavirus?Dr Guleria: My feeling is that it would not. It might decrease the transmissibility of the virus. We still have cases in tropical countries like Singapore and Thailand. A large number of us spend a lot of time inside the house or shopping malls, areas which are air-conditioned. And here the temperature is low and there is crowding. If one person has the infection and he is coughing, the person can spread the virus.Should malls and restaurants be avoided?Dr Guleria: As of now, till we are not sure about the resolution of this pandemic, I would say that we should take to the process of social distancing.Can a person cured of novel coronavirus get it again?Dr Guleria: This is a viral infection unlike swine flu or H1N1 but once you are exposed to the infection, there is a chance of getting it again. Once you get the infection, there are antibodies produced in the body which protect you against subsequent infection or make it less severe. If you get exposed to novel coronavirus, later on, it will be a mild infection.Is social distancing the best way to tackle this disease in a country like India?Dr Guleria: The UK is following a similar model where it is allowing the infection to spread to the community but protect the high-risk groups (elderly, diabetic, hypertension, heart or respiratory issues). Since the mortality in the younger age group is very low, you may have a large number of individuals who may get the infection and cause herd immunity and therefore, you might not have a very large outbreak.However, young people can still transmit the disease to the elderly which is why herd community can create problems in a country like India.Do yoga and pranayam build immunity against Covid-19?Dr Guleria: There is no evidence to support that yoga or pranayam or ayurvedic or homoeopathic drugs are effective as far as treatment of Covid-19 is concerned.Are blood donors screened for novel coronavirus?Dr Guleria: Blood donors are not tested for novel coronavirus. It is important to understand that this is a novel coronavirus which was not there as far as humans are concerned as of last year. It is an animal virus that mutated and jumped species and became a human virus and it also developed the ability to sustain human-human spread. But the chances of it being significantly present in the blood are low; it is mainly in the upper-respiratory fact. Blood testing is not required for healthy people as of now.Will sipping hot water kill the virus?Dr Guleria: Neither sipping hot water nor consumption of alcohol will kill the virus. Alcohol-based sanitisers kill the virus on your hands but once in your throat, the virus infects the cells and alcohol cannot help there.Are hand sanitisers better than soap?Dr Guleria: If you can use soap with water, it is a better thing. One uses soap more thoroughly and it helps clear the virus in between the fingers and under the nails. If you do not have soap, use hand sanitiser but clean your hands thoroughly and regularly.Will cleaning doorknobs keep novel coronavirus away?Dr Guleria: One of the ways the novel coronavirus spreads is through droplet infection. Droplet means that it is in the air for some time and people who come in close contact with someone who has the infection get infected. But these droplets also settle on surfaces and touching these surfaces can lead to infection. If someone infected with novel coronavirus touches a doorknob with his hands, the infection will settle on the doorknob for a few hours and it is a good idea to clean it.How long does the virus survive on surfaces?Dr Guleria: Depends on the surface. Some data suggests that it can survive on cardboard for a few hours or other surfaces which are metal-based and especially if the temperature is low and the humidity is high, it may even survive 6-8 hours. That is why it is important to regularly wash hours.Will a cough droplet that falls on one's clothes infect someone?Dr Guleria: If you touch the cough droplet on your clothes with your hands and then touch your face, it can lead to infection. Touching one's face should be avoided. The cough droplet cannot reach one's respiratory tract by itself.Should non -vegetarian food be avoided?Dr Guleria: There is no evidence right now. Eating well-cooked non-vegetarian food outside or at home poses no risk of coronavirus.What precautions should pregnant women take?Dr Guleria: There is no data suggesting that like swine flu, pregnant woman are at a higher risk. Pregnant women should avoid crowded areas.Any precautions before taking a flight?Dr Guleria: One should avoid non-essential travel. If you are travelling, regular hand washing is important.What underlying conditions can prove risky?Dr Guleria: Whatever data we have from China suggests that some groups are at a higher risk. These include elderly; those above the age of 60 have a more severe infection. People with co-morbidities such as diabetes, hypertension, chronic heart or respiratory diseases are also at a higher risk and need to be extra careful.Will Covid-19 outbreak worsen before it ends?Dr Guleria: Global trends suggest that the infection is still on the rise and has not reached a plateau. The number of cases is rising all over the world. There will be rise over the next few weeks until that plateau is reached and then we will see a downward trend as can be seen in China and South Korea.Are Indians more immune to coronavirus than others?Dr Guleria: There is no data to suggest this.Does smoking affect chances of recovery?Dr Guleria: Smoking does decrease the respiratory defence mechanism and therefore, the recovery does slow down. I would advise people to either decrease or quit smoking.What type of masks is preferred?Dr Guleria: The N-95 and triple-aid masks are for healthcare workers operating in hospitals and infected areas. The self-made face cover does not have a very strong filter but it helps in reducing the transmission. If everyone covers their face with self-made masks, including people who have a very mild coronavirus infection, the droplets of water will not jump from host to host.At what point should one get tested for Covid-19?Dr Guleria: The symptoms of coronavirus are very non-specific. If I have a little bit of fever and get tested, it would be a waste of resources. It is important to get people with severe symptoms and healthcare workers tested because we do not want them to contract the infection. The elderly and those with co-morbid conditions are at a higher risk, diagnosing them and treating them is important.Can an asymptomatic person spread the virus?Dr Guleria: Initial data pointed out that this was unlikely but some data suggests that some percentage of individuals may be having no symptoms but they could still be spreading the disease, especially in the younger age group and that has emerged in the last few weeks.Should senior citizens with mild cough also get tested?Dr Guleria: There is no need for that. However, senior citizens must try and stay at home and wash their hands frequently. Solution is not testing, the solution is preventing not getting the infection.Is the fecal transmission of coronavirus possible?Dr Guleria: Studies suggest that there can be a fecal-oral transmission. It is unlikely to be a major area of transmission but this is still an area of research.How long does it take to recover from Covid-19?Dr Guleria: It depends on what type of illness you have. According to the breakup that we have, 80 per cent of individuals will have a mild or asymptomatic disease and they will recover on their own within 5-7 days. You have another 15 per cent who have a border disease, may need hospitalisation and they will recover within 10-15 days. The remaining 5 per cent who have a severe disease will be in the ICU, may need ventilator support and they may take about three weeks to recover.Why are youngsters getting infected more in India?Dr Guleria: India has a younger population as compared to other countries and the degree of mobility is much higher and that's why the transmission is much higher in youngsters. Mortality is directly linked to age.Does hydroxychloroquine work?Dr Guleria: We had initially one study from France. More recently, another study has come up from China which suggests that giving hydroxychloroquine to Covid-19 patients can decrease the viral load, decreasing the days of admission in hospital required. So, there is some evidence although it is limited. We need more data to establish a clear link.Do vitamin-supplements build immunity against coronavirus?Dr Guleria: Some data suggests that Vitamin-C may be helpful. For the other vitamins, there is not much data. There is no harm in taking it but it cannot be said for sure that it may help.Does staying in the sun between 10 am and 11 am build immunity against Covid-19?Dr Guleria: There is no data suggesting that staying in the sun or warmer temperature helps against the virus. The virus is inside the body and body temperature won't decrease by staying in the sun. Also, we are having another outbreak in Singapore where the weather is much warmer and tropical. Similarly with southern India where the temperature is not helping in the reduction of transmission.Watch: Coronavirus FAQs | Part 2What should patients awaiting surgeries do?Dr Guleria: In this era of Covid-19, we should also focus on non-coronavirus patients. We should also see once what can be done about surgeries once the lockdown is lifted. Emergency surgeries are being done, dialysis is also being done. We are also working on teleconsultation. It's important for people with co-morbid conditions. A person on hemodialysis should be getting it as per schedule.Is it safe to buy newspapers?Dr Guleria: It is safe to buy newspapers because it is not like the person delivering the newspaper is infected because if he was infected, the delivery person would have symptoms and those who are concerned can see how they can clean their newspapers thoroughly. The chance of transmission through newspapers is very little.There are issues about how long can the virus survive on surfaces. It can survive on newspapers, cardboard boxes, and metal cans for some hours and even on plastics and steel surfaces for a longer period of time. If you are using these boxes or getting them from the market, take time and clean it properly with an antiseptic solution.Are takeaway pizzas and food delivery safe?Dr Guleria: Pizza itself is cooked at a very high temperature. It will kill any bacteria or virus that is there. If you are still concerned, clean the outer surfaces which may have been touched by people with cloth dipped in an anti-septic or alcohol-based wash. That will provide enough safety.Is it safe to receive packages from areas with Covid-19 cases?Dr Guleria: Chances of transmission of the coronavirus through packages are quite low. If you are really concerned, clean the package from outside with an anti-septic solution.Is virus less virulent in countries with BCG immunisation?Dr Guleria: There is this hypothesis which suggests that those in countries with BCG immunisation, their immune system are a bit more resilient due to the vaccines. However, it is too early to say whether BCG can prevent Covid-19 because it is meant to counter micro-bacterial tuberculosis.Why do fatality rates vary in different countries?Dr Guleria: Fatality rates depend on the age of the population and the number of cases per day. Flattening the curve by means of the lockdown has led to a reduction of mortality.Are blood tests as effective as oral swabs?Dr Guleria: A nasal swab is meant to pick up the virus in your throat or the posterior part of your nose, therefore, it tells you whether the virus is there and you are infected or not. The blood test does not pick up the virus. If you have early symptoms, the blood test will be negative for Covid-19. It looks at anti-bodies your body produces once you have had the infection and these anti-bodies will remain positive for months.If I was infected with coronavirus a month ago but I'm all right now and decide to get an antibody test done, my anti-body will still be positive although I have no infection.Can rapid testing help in containing the outbreak?Dr Guleria: The rapid test will give us information about how the Covid-19 infection is panning out in different parts of the country. If the rapid test suggests that a lot of people in one region test positive, then one can say that there is still ongoing infection in that region. If you do rapid tests in a region where a lot of people are symptomatic but most of them test negative, it can be said that their symptoms are not related to coronavirus but common flu.Have we managed to avoid community spread?Dr Guleria: Extensive community spread is not there but there are definitely hotspots that have developed where there is suspicion about limited community spread and we need to really see how to clamp down on this because this should not further progress. If we can aggressively prevent localised spread which has occurred in hotspots then we can prevent community spread.Coronavirus in India is less virulent than in the rest of the world?Dr Guleria: Not too much data suggests that the virus is behaving differently in different parts of the world but I do believe that we have to look at the virus more critically, find out whether it has mutated and are we getting a strain that is less virulent.The lockdown has helped because the rise in the number of cases is not rapid in other countries. Data coming in after April 12 will give us a clear picture of whether or not it is wise to partially lift the lockdown.(The first part of this interview was aired on March 17, 2020)(The second part of this interview was aired on April 4, 2020)READ | Hospitals turning coronavirus containment zones is India's biggest worry this World Health DayWATCH PART I OF INTERVIEW | Coronavirus in India FAQs: Watch AIIMS director answer common questions about Covid-19WATCH PART II OF INTERVIEW | AIIMS director answers frequently asked questions on Covid-19"

The pandemic has been caused by a new form of coronavirus that was unknown to scientists until just months ago. And so, along with the virus's spread across the growth, myths about the contagion, treatments for the Covid-19 disease and preventive steps to keep yourself safe from the novel coronavirus have proliferated.It is very important to refrain from placing your belief in any miraculous cures or conspiracy theories about Covid-19. And so, in this report we take a look at some widely shared myths about the novel coronavirus and weight their standing on the scale of scientific relevance. Use the links below to navigate:Myth 1: Temperature, humidity could affect transmission rate of Covid-19Myth 2: Wearing a mask can prevent transmission of Covid-19Myth 3: Taking a hot bath can prevent infectionMyth 4: Drinking alcohol can cure Covid-19Myth 5: Non-vegetarian food (meat) consumption can lead to infectionMyth 6: Holding breath for 10 seconds acts as test for Covid-19Myth 7: Visit a hospital if you are experiencing cough, high feverMyth 8: Garlic boosts the immunity systemMyth 9: Donating blood can result in Covid-19 testingMyth 10: Mosquito bites can fast track transmissionMyth 11: Hand dryers/ ultraviolet disinfection lamp can kill the virusMyth 12: Vaccines against pneumonia protect against novel coronavirusMyth 13: Parcels from China can spread Covid-19Myth 14: Thermal scanners can detect novel coronavirusMyth 15: Novel coronavirus affects only elderly, not young people MYTH: Temperature, humidity could affect transmission rate of Covid-19Truth: This is a myth. The World Health Organisation (WHO) has observed that this infection can be transmitted in any and all areas regardless of climate.MYTH: Wearing a mask can prevent transmission of Covid-19Truth: Initially, the popular advice on masks was that it should be worn only by those infected by the novel coronavirus or those caring for them. However, health bodies -- including India's Ministry of Health -- have revised their positions over time and advised people to wear masks (mostly homemade) when they step out of their home. There is no scientific eveidence that masks -- especially those made at home -- protect the wearer from the novel coronavirus. However, there is evidence that masks can prevent an asymptomatic patient of Covid-19 from unwittingly spreading the virus. That is why government bodies have revised their advice on wearing masks.MYTH: Taking a hot bath can prevent infectionTruth: This is a myth. The normal body temperature remains stable between 36.5°C to 37°C despite the temperature of one's bath, says the WHO.MYTH: Drinking alcohol can cure Covid-19Truth: There is no evidence whatsoever to prove this claim. While alcohol-based hand sanitizers are a recommended precaution against any virus, drinking alcohol while seeking to cure Covid-19 is the same as drinking alcohol-based hand sanitizer and expecting it to taste like a pint of beer.MYTH: Non-vegetarian food (meat) consumption can lead to infectionTruth: It has been established that the novel coronavirus jumped species from an animal to a man and is originally a zoonotic disease. However, no known animal species has been known to carry this virus as of yet and medical experts have asked people not to believe in rumours and eat non-vegetarian meals as long as they are prepared with utmost care for hygiene.MYTH: Holding breath for 10 seconds acts as test for Covid-19Truth: This is a myth. Dr Faheem Younus, the Chief of Infectious Diseases at the University of Maryland says that a person infected with the novel coronavirus can also hold his/her breath for longer than 10 seconds. On the other hand, the elderly will not be able to accomplish this task but it does not in any way mean that they are infected. MYTH: Visit a hospital if you are experiencing cough, high feverTruth: Director of AIIMS, Dr Randeep Guleria says that one should not visit a hospital during a pandemic since it increases the chances of a healthy person catching the virus. One should consult a doctor over the phone if he/she is experiencing any symptoms at all and seek future course of action.MYTH: Garlic boosts the immunity systemTruth: This is a myth. There is no scientific evidence to suggest that the consumption of garlic boosts the immunity system or safeguards one from being infected with Covid-19.MYTH: Donating blood can result in Covid-19 testingTruth: This is untrue. One should not donate blood at a time like this unless and until one is absolutely sure that he/she is not infected.WATCH | AIIMS top doc busts five common coronavirus mythsMYTH: Mosquito bites can fast track transmissionTruth: This is a myth. No study or research has shown that mosquitoes can act as carriers of the novel coronavirus. ""The new coronavirus is a respiratory virus which spreads primarily through droplets generated when an infected person coughs or sneezes, or through droplets of saliva or discharge from the nose,"" says WHO.MYTH: Hand dryers/ ultraviolet disinfection lamp can kill the virusTruth: These are myths. According to the World Health Organisation (WHO), one should regularly wash one's hands with soap and water for 20 seconds. Apart from this, neither a hand dryer nor an ultraviolet disinfection lamp can kill the virus.MYTH: Vaccines against pneumonia protect against novel coronavirusTruth: This is a myth. Pneumococcal vaccine and Haemophilus influenza type B (Hib) vaccine cannot protect anyone from Covid-19 since the vaccine for the new coronavirus is yet to be discovered. MYTH: Parcels from China can spread Covid-19Truth: This is untrue. While some preliminary research has shown that the novel coronavirus remains on certain surfaces such as cardboard for some time, it cannot spread through parcels received from China.MYTH: Thermal scanners can detect novel coronavirusTruth: This is not entirely true. A thermal scanner detects body temperature and is great for identifying someone with a high fever, however, medical experts and doctors treating Covid-19 patients have said that initial research shows how people who display no symptoms can also be infected with the virus.MYTH: Novel coronavirus affects only elderly, not young peopleTruth: This is untrue. The transmission of novel coronavirus has been seen in people of all ages. Doctors suggest that people with co-morbid conditions such as blood pressure, heart or respiratory diseases are at a higher risk if they get infected with Covid-19. However, a perfectly healthy person can also be infected in the presence of a Covid-19 patient.(Update on April 15, 2020: The section on wearing masks has been updated to reflect new information and changes in advisories issued by countries including India)READ | Fact Check: Don't believe this home remedy to cure Covid-19ALSO READ | India breathes better with humans confined to homesWATCH | Coronavirus: Global economy now in recession, says IMF"

It has killed tens of thousands, disrupted daily life in ways that would have seemed unthinkable at the start of the new year, and now poses a dire threat to the health of the world economy. The World Health Organisation says the coronavirus pandemic is the ""defining global health crisis of our time"", capable of revealing the best and worst in humanity. On April 22, the WHO's director-general said the virus ""will be with us for a long time"", pointing to the early stages of outbreaks in some countries, and an uptick of cases in others.This comprehensive guide to the coronavirus pandemic has all the important information you need to protect yourself, your family and your community.

SARS-CoV-2 is the name of the new coronavirus; it causes the respiratory disease Covid-19. (Photo: Rocky Mountain Laboratories, US National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases)First things first. ""Coronavirus"" isn't the name of the pathogen that's been sickening and killing people around the world these past few months.Coronaviruses are actually a big family of viruses, named for the crown-like effect created by spikes on their surface -- these are actually proteins that help them invade human cells. Some coronaviruses, in fact, cause the common cold.What we're dealing with right now is a new, or novel coronavirus. It has a name: SARS-CoV-2. (Pronounce the first two parts like words: ""saars"" and ""kawv"".)Don't confuse SARS-CoV-2 with the coronavirus that caused the outbreak of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) in 2003 -- they're related, but not the same.Click on the photographs below to get a closer look. A 3-D print of a spike protein of the SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus, in front of 3-D print of the whole virus particle. (PHOTO ABOVE: US National Institutes of Health (NIH). PHOTOS BELOW: US National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, part of the US NIH.)IMAGE SAMPLESSo, what is Covid-19, then?That's the name of the respiratory illness caused by the new coronavirus. Short for coronavirus disease 2019, it was first detected when a cluster of mysterious pneumonia cases emerged in China's Wuhan city late last year. (Pronounce Covid-19 like a word, too: ""ko-vid-nineteen"".)Now, how does the new coronavirus spread? What symptoms does it produce? What can you do to reduce infection risk?Find out in the next section.Covid-19: How it spreads, and key precautions A robot developed by a start-up firm, Asimov Robotics, distributing face masks and sanitiser, and providing information about coronavirus precautions, in Kochi, on March 17, 2020. (Photo: Reuters)The World Health Organisation (WHO) says the new coronavirus mostly spreads through respiratory droplets leaving an infected person's mouth or nose when he (or she) coughs, breathes out or even talks -- and when these are either inhaled or ingested by a healthy individual, or transferred by hand from a contaminated surface to his eyes, nose, or mouth.There's evidence that the coronavirus can hold out for a long time on surfaces: A recent US study showed it can survive for up to four hours on copper, a day on cardboard and two or three days on plastic and stainless steel. It also survives in aerosols -- droplets suspended in the air -- for as long as three hours.There are also indications that people carrying the virus but without symptoms -- known as asymptomatic individuals -- can give it to other people, according to the WHO.There's no vaccine or specific anti-viral treatment for the coronavirus yet, only supportive care. But the race to develop a vaccine is intensifying, with one group of researchers at Oxford University hoping to develop a million doses by September.How can you protect yourself? Here's a list of precautionary measures based on information provided by the World Health Organisation, the Indian government, and the US Centres for Disease Control and Prevention.PRECAUTIONSRegularly wash your hands with soap and water, or with an handrub (sanitiser) with at least 60% alcohol. Soap in particular is super-effective, as it dissolves the fat membrane of the coronavirus, causing it to ""fall apart like a house of cards"", according to a tweet-thread recently posted by Pall Thordarson (@PalliThordarson), a professor of chemistry at the University of New South Wales.STOP TOUCHING YOUR FACE. Yes, it's REALLY hard -- we know -- but this prevents you from transferring the virus to your eyes, mouth or nose if your hands have been contaminated by contact with a surface or a patient.When you cough or sneeze, cover your face with a bent elbow or tissue -- which you should then dispose of quickly and safely.Practice social distancing. If you are in India, you are under lockdown -- and so this should already be happening. If you do need to step out (to buy essentials, for example), make sure you stay at least 1 metre away from other people. In fact, many are advising a distance of nearly 2 metres (6 feet).If you are a senior citizen -- or suffer from pre-existing medical conditions like heart disease or diabetes -- social distancing and other precautions are especially crucial. These groups are at greater risk for serious illness.Avoid handshakes and hugs while greeting people.Avoid all non-essential travel.Disinfect surfaces that you frequently touch, including your phone. (See below for a link to our guide.)Don't panic, but don't be complacent either.MORE ON PRECAUTIONS1. In early April, the Indian government said homemade face covers were recommended for healthy individuals. Click here for more information.2. Here's how you can disinfect your phone.The symptoms, and what to do if you have them A woman wearing a face mask at a nearly-deserted bank of the Ganga river in Varanasi, on March 20, 2020. (Photo: PTI)What are the symptoms of a Covid-19 infection? Here's what the World Health Organisation says. (Read the full WHO Q&A here.)What are the most common symptoms?""The most common symptoms of Covid-19 are fever, dry cough, and tiredness. Some patients may have aches and pains, nasal congestion, sore throat or diarrhea. These symptoms are usually mild and begin gradually. Some people become infected but only have very mild symptoms.""Also check out this article on evidence for the loss of smell in coronavirus-infected people. And this one, about a condition nicknamed ""Covid toes"".Does everyone who's infected become very sick?""Most people (about 80%) recover from the disease without needing hospital treatment. Around 1 out of every 5 people who gets Covid-19 becomes seriously ill and develops difficulty breathing.""Are there some groups at greater risk for serious illness?""Older people, and those with underlying medical problems like high blood pressure, heart and lung problems, diabetes, or cancer , are at higher risk of developing serious illness. However anyone can catch Covid-19 and become seriously ill. Even people with very mild symptoms of Covid-19 can transmit the virus. People of all ages who experience fever, cough and difficulty breathing should seek medical attention.""When should you seek help?""If you have minor symptoms, such as a slight cough or a mild fever, there is generally no need to seek medical care. Stay at home, self-isolate and monitor your symptoms. Follow national guidance on self-isolation. However, if you live in an area with malaria or dengue fever it is important that you do not ignore symptoms of fever.""""Seek immediate medical care if you have difficulty breathing or pain/pressure in the chest. If possible, call your health care provider in advance, so he/she can direct you to the right health facility.""Are you in India? Read this: India's coronavirus helpline number is +91-11-23978046 (the toll-free helpline is 1075), and the dedicated e-mail ID is ncov2019@gov.in. The government is encouraging citizens to download and use a contact tracing app, Aarogya Setu. (Learn more here.)Coronavirus: It can potentially kill, but how deadly is it? In Prague, capital of the Czech Republic, this man was taking a picture of a poster of the late Li Wenliang, a Chinese ophthalmologist who died of the novel coronavirus at a hospital in Wuhan earlier this year. Many Chinese consider Li, who was 33, to be a hero: he was accused by authorities of spreading rumours when he alerted his fellow doctors to the outbreak. (Photo: Reuters)The global death toll from the coronavirus pandemic is in the tens of thousands, and continues to rise. But what is the mortality rate? In other words, what percentage of patients succumb to Covid-19 (the disease caused by the novel coronavirus)?For now, we can't tell for sure -- recent estimates have ranged from below 1% to up to 4%, far lower than the figures for two previous epidemics caused by coronaviruses, Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) and Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS).As we've said earlier, the elderly and people with pre-existing medical conditions are more at risk for serious disease. In February, a Chinese study of 44,672 confirmed cases in Mainland China reported an overall death rate of 2.3%. But the figure was 14.8% for for people older than 80, and only 0.2% for ages 10 through 39.Most people with Covid-19 get better without special treatment -- approximately 80%, according to the World Health Organisation.But that's not an excuse to not report symptoms. If you show signs of a Covid-19 infection, have travelled to a country where the disease has been spreading or think you've been in contact with a suspected or confirmed patient, PLEASE seek help.Since the pandemic reached India, there have been alarming reports of high-risk behaviour, such as suspected Covid-19 patients leaving hospitals without clearance. We don't need to stress how dangerous this is -- please cooperate with medical and government authorities.'Flattening the curve': Why is it important? A deserted Gateway of India in Mumbai, on March 19, 2020. (Photo: PTI)If you're in India, perhaps you're asking yourself why authorities have locked down the country for weeks. In fact, even before Prime Minister Narendra Modi announced the shutdown on March 24, restaurants and malls were being ordered shut, exams were postponed, and employees who could were being asked to work from home.[UPDATE: India has since begun diluting its lockdown measures in an attempt to partially reopen the economy.]This kind of collective effort at social distancing -- combined with hand and respiratory hygiene practices that reduce the risk of transmission (JUMP TO SECTION), and public health measures like testing and contact tracing -- is crucial in the fight against coronavirus pandemic.We need to ""flatten the curve"" of infections. It's pretty simple. Imagine a graph that plots the rise and fall of coronavirus cases over time. What you don't want is a steep peak in a very short amount of time -- one that could overburden the healthcare system.So it's better if the curve is more staggered, but flatter. That can happen when a community adopts aggressive containment strategies, including social distancing.Together, we can flatten the curve by practicing social distancing, staying home when sick, and washing hands often. This will reduce the strain on our hospitals and emergency rooms, and literally save the lives of our most vulnerable residents. #COVID19 #NovelCoronavirus pic.twitter.com/6Yzvg3DONvLA Public Health (@lapublichealth) March 15, 2020
Before you move on, a note on lockdowns: they are part of the toolkit, but they aren't enough.Hear it from Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, the director-general of the World Health Organisation: ""Asking people to stay at home and shutting down population movement is buying time and reducing the pressure on health systems.""""But on their own, these measures will not extinguish epidemics.""So what else is needed? Here are six actions recommended by the WHO.Expand, train, deploy healthcare and public health workforceImplement system to find all suspected cases at community levelIncrease production, capacity, availability of testingIdentify, adapt, equip facilities for isolation and treatmentCreate plan and process for quarantining contactsRefocus whole of government on coronavirus fightFor Indian citizens Preventive measures against the new coronavirus disease, Covid-19, are displayed at a Mumbai bus stop, on March 18, 2020. (Photo: Reuters)India is currently fighting a growing outbreak of the new coronavirus, so it's natural for the public to be concerned. But panicking isn't the solution. In fact, it can be dangerous: stockpiling essentials and hoarding masks or sanitiser, for example, creates shortages for others.But you should follow precautions (JUMP TO SECTION) that help prevent the spread of the virus. That includes simple measures like cleaning your hands regularly with soap and water -- or sanitiser -- and not touching your face. Social distancing is the buzzword these days, and for good reason: reducing your proximity to other people -- by standing at least a metre away if you're face-to-face, and re-organising your life to keep yourself at home as much as possible -- helps enormously.

(Photo: Reuters)India began emerging from the world's longest coronavirus lockdown in early June. But despite ordering its population of 1.3 billion indoors for over two months, it has watched cases rise steadily — for example, it added more than 10,000 on June 12 in an unprecedented single-day spike. The world’s largest democracy is now among the five worst-affected nations, and is, in the view of one senior opposition leader, ""firmly on its way to winning the wrong race”. The ruling BJP, on its part, has defended its government’s ""bold and timely"" decisions to fight the SARS-CoV-2 virus despite facing criticism on several fronts. These include the harrowing plight of stranded migrant workers leaving cities for their hometowns — several have died: from the heat and from exhaustion, in road and train accidents, and on special trains launched to help them travel — and a financial stimulus effort seen by a top global ratings agency as insufficient to buoy real GDP growth rates to ""around 8 per cent, which had seemed within reach just a few years ago”. Beds being installed for a quarantine facility inside Guwahati's Sarusajai Sports Complex on March 29, 2020. (Photo: Reuters)Despite the rise in caseload, the medical research body ICMR continues to insist India hasn't reached the community transmission stage, a view that has no shortage of skeptics. Community spread describes the advanced stage of an outbreak where the pathogen is rampant, and new patients are no longer able to pinpoint the source of their infection. The health minister of Delhi, one of India’s worst hit territories, admitted on June 10 that there was ""transmission in the community”, but added that only the central government could make a declaration about community spread.There are mixed views on India’s decision to gradually open its economy, which was already in the grip of a slowdown before the pandemic struck with devastating force. A top business leader recently pointed to the need to save both lives and livelihoods — news of layoffs abounds — as she voiced support for easing restrictions, while also underscoring the importance of keeping the mortality rate low. But in early June, several worrying signs remained: the uptick in cases continued, hospital beds were in short supply and the test positivity rate was higher than the threshold considered by the WHO to be appropriate justification for relaxing social distancing measures.Where does India go from here? We’ll have to wait and watch.Stages of transmission Graffiti on a Chennai road, created to spread awareness about social distancing, seen on April 9, 2020. (Photo: Reuters)How freely is the coronavirus spreading in India? Is it only infecting people in close contact with patients who caught it while travelling abroad? Or is it already fanning out into the community and stealthily sickening people who can't tell where or from whom they got it?If you've been wondering what the ongoing debate on transmission stages is about -- well, this is the essence of it.There are four transmission stages. In Stage 1, infections are limited to arrivals from countries where the virus has been spreading -- say, China or Italy. In Stage 2, known as local transmission, people contract the virus from patients ""importing"" it, so it's still possible to pinpoint the sources of infection. This changes in Stage 3, known as community transmission: the pathogen now spreads so freely in the population that patients can no longer trace their infections to a place they visited or another person who has the virus. And in Stage 4, the caseload and death toll swell to such an extent that there appears to be no end in sight to the outbreak. (Click here for a NewsMo video on the four transmission stages.)So, at what stage is India's outbreak?An ICMR study on Severe Acute Respiratory Illness (SARI) patients tested for the coronavirus disease showed that 40 out of 102 people found to be carrying the virus ""did not report any history of contact or international travel"", pointing to community spread.In early April, the director of AIIMS (Delhi), Dr Randeep Guleria, said most of India was at Stage 2 but also appealed for vigilance, pointing to ""localised community spread"" in ""a few pockets"". The government said his views were ""not in variance"" with its own stand.It said India was ""between Stage 2 and 3"".In early May, Health Minister Harsh Vardhan said India had so far been able to avoid community transmission of the virus. On June 11, the ICMR maintained that India hadn't yet reached Stage 3, a position viewed by some with skepticism. For example, a former AIIMS director, Dr MC Misra, says community spread began -- albeit in a small way -- back in March.Fighting fake news People clapping and beating utensils to show their appreciation for essential service providers during a ""janata curfew"", in Delhi, on March 22, 2020. (Photo: PTI)When Prime Minister Narendra Modi asked the public to observe a voluntary ""janata curfew"" on March 22, he invited them to clap, ring bells or beat utensils at 5 pm to laud professionals working to provide essential services. Soon, messages on social media were claiming the coordinated applause and percussion would cause the coronavirus to lose its ""potency"" -- bogus, obviously.Fake news on the current pandemic is rife. India Today TV fact-checkers have exposed fake cures and false advisories on eating bakery items, shaving facial hair, or using a 10-second breath hold as a way to test for infections. In February, the World Health Organisation said it was fighting not just the virus, but also ""trolls and conspiracy theorists who push misinformation and undermine the outbreak response"".One particularly explosive claim that's been refuted by researchers is the idea that the coronavirus is a Chinese bio-weapon -- the basis for a U.S. lawsuit seeking $20 trillion in damages from China, a figure greater than its GDP.As the pandemic progresses, we need to make sure we're consuming and sharing authentic information on the virus.

https://www.indiatoday.in/news-analysis/story/shenxianwan-the-toughest-china-post-that-guards-karakoram-pass-1695568-2020-06-30,2020-07-01 01:06:00,Shenxianwan: The ‘toughest’ China post that guards Karakoram Pass,"India has been painstakingly improving the infrastructure in eastern Ladakh’s Daulat Beg Oldie (DBO) sector over the last decade.The DBO advance landing ground was reactivated in 2013 when the Indian Air Force landed a C130 transport aircraft there. At 16,614 feet above sea level, it was the highest ever landing of a C130 aircraft in 50 years of worldwide service.China made this a pretext to ramp up its posts all along the border, especially in occupied eastern Ladakh. Gen Xu Qiliang, who had just taken over the office of Vice Chairman of Central Military Commission (CMC) under Xi Jinping as the Chairman, visited the forward posts and directed an increase in strength and equipment.Importance of Karakoram PassThe strategic significance of Karakoram Pass cannot be overemphasised. Strategically it is the easiest route connecting Ladakh with the Tarim Basin. In the previous centuries, Karakoram Pass played a very important role in the flourishing trade along the Silk Route. The trade route became obsolete as China grabbed Tibet and East Turkestan (Xinjiang) in the 1940s and 50s.After Xu Qiliang’s visit, a particular post called Shenxianwan (), literally meaning ‘Fairy Bay’ and situated 7km north of Karakoram Pass, came into prominence.The India Today OSINT team takes a closer look at Shenxianwan post in detail through Google Earth and other open-source satellite imagery.Shenxianwan PostThe PLA post, supposedly the highest point, is located at 5,265m, the point where observation tower is located.It was given the medal of honour and title of “Karakoram Steel Border Outpost” (). Shenxianwan, that faces 180 days of high-speed winds in a year and minus 30°C temperatures, is considered the toughest posting in the entire country.Just for comparison, Indian posts in Drass go below 80°C with maximum wind chill effect. The temperatures and wind chill effects on Siachen glacier posts would be beyond Chinese imagination.Details of the PostThe Shenxianwan post was established as a section post in the 1950s when PLA grabbed Xinjiang, but continued to increase in strength and resources to a company and now possibly a battalion post.Like other PLA posts, it has defences with communication trenches towards India and a large watchtower located at the highest point. A large dish antenna has been observed shifting its locations since 2010, possibly for satellite communications to the remote place.The post has four large buildings for the accommodation of troops and one longish barrack for motor transport parking and cookhouse.The post has two large groups of solar panels to cater for electricity requirements of the post.The usual motivational slogan and Chinese map are etched on the mountain facing the post, large enough to be visible from space. Road to the Post and BeyondThe road coming from Yarkand to the post was earlier a fair-weather road without any bridges. After 2013, when Xu Qiliang took over under the directions of Xi Jinping, the road infrastructure has been improved tremendously.The road which ended at the post earlier has now been extended right till the top of Karakoram Pass.Radar at Karakoram PassThe Karakoram Pass has seen Chinese troops coming and staying at the pass for a day or two and returning.Satellite images have also caught a vehicle-based phased array radar located at Karakoram pass with the array directed towards India. This would be probably to monitor air activities in the gully from DBO airport to Karakoram Pass which is possibly not visible to the radar at Tianwendian post located in Depsang area.

https://www.indiatoday.in/india-today-insight/story/let-there-be-satellite-imagery-1695684-2020-07-01,2020-07-01 02:55:00,Let there be satellite imagery | India Today Insight," Since the Pangong Tso lake and Galwan valley—the two sites in eastern Ladakh where Indian and Chinese troops clashed in May and June respectively—are both in military-controlled terrain, a lot of the reporting on the ongoing standoff has relied on a combination of satellite imagery and information from military sources.The images have allowed the public to grasp the gravity of the situation since they're able to compare and contrast images before and after the deadly clash on June 15. It's obvious that each government will blame the other but the Indian prime minister came under the scanner when he denied the Chinese intrusion into Indian territory. The opposition and security analysts were quick to slam the comments and the prime minister's office was forced to issue a clarification saying it ""pertained to the situation as a consequence of the bravery of our armed forces”. Soon after that, satellite images released by independent analysts and space technology companies like Maxar and Planet Labs began showing the Chinese build-up on the embankment of the Galwan river, near the site of the clash.But this was not the first time the Chinese had walked back on commitments in meetings with Indian counterparts. Consider the June 6 talks led by lieutenant-generals from both armies after a series of scuffles were noted along the border in May. After the talks, the Chinese did scale back since satellite images from June 9 show that the Chinese infrastructure—an observation post that had been spotted on the Indian side of the LAC on May 22—had been dismantled. But the tent came back up on June 14. The flare-up eventually led to the violent clash of June 15. On June 16, Reuters published a satellite image that showed debris in the area, which analysts claimed may have been the observation post.This is one reason why satellite imagery is so fascinating. The images throw a curveball on statements issued by governments vying to keep an upper hand in the ongoing standoff. But the images alone, when offered without commentary, do little to help the public understand what really is going on. But since commentary is inextricably tied to human biases, there is room for error here as well.In 2018, for example, the New York Times found itself under the scanner for publishing an article—based on a report by the US-based think-tank CSIS (Center for Strategic and International Studies)—which claimed that North Korea was going ahead with nuclear missile development in violation of the Singapore agreement earlier that year. Long term Korea analyst Tim Shorrock, however, wrote that all images used in the CSIS report were from March, nearly three months before Trump and Kim Jong Un met in Singapore and signed the new agreement.ALSO READ | Smartphones change news reportage on contested Himalayan borderBut at other times, in the event of contradictory claims, satellite images prove useful. Commercial satellite imagery was available during the 1999 Kargil War fought in what is now the Ladakh union territory (UT), but these were prohibitively expensive and held by a few countries. The army purchased these for Rs 35,000 a frame ‘from a friendly country’ to know more about the Pakistan Army’s creeping deployments across the line of control, but as then army chief General V.P. Malik noted at a public event last December, they were three years old and hence quite useless. The Indian armed forces and intelligence agencies now have multiple imaging satellites that tell them the ground situation, but these are not available to the public. The proliferation of commercial geospatial satellite imagery—DigitalGlobe offers 30 centimetre resolutions from its satellite constellation—means days-old imagery can be purchased by the general public for a ring-side view of the build-up.By now, we know the Chinese have expanded into the Galwan-Hot Springs-Pangong Tso area, as well as in the Depsang area north of the Galwan valley. Satellite images have clearly shown pink tarpaulins appearing on the same site of the clash on June 22. We know that defensive positions were built between June 17 and 22 since June 16 images show no infrastructure. Analysts have had differing interpretations of what this means because the LAC is so fuzzy. Journalists have said that the new structures are 1.5 km inside the Indian territory but Lt General (retd) A.L. Chavan, who served as a division commander of the 3rd Infantry Division (responsible for Ladakh) in 2013 when the Depsang valley standoff happened, told The Indian Express that he was not sure whether the positions were built on the Indian or the Chinese side of the LAC “because without an accurate survey and enlarged maps, ascertaining the exact alignment of the LAC as claimed by the two sides is not possible”. By June 25, India Today TV reported the presence of 16 PLA camps on the Galwan river banks.The differing perception of the LAC by India and China, in spite of satellite images, may partially explain the war of words that have continued between the two sides despite an 11-hour marathon meeting at the corps commander level at Moldo-Chushul on June 21. Vikram Misri, the Indian ambassador to China, was quoted by PTI saying that ""India hopes China will realise its responsibility in de-escalation and disengage by moving back to its side of the LAC"". Misri's statement also came a day after the Chinese envoy to India, in an interview with PTI, put the blame squarely on India. Misri has rubbished China's claims on the Galwan valley.Though the media reported that the June 21 talks were fruitful, satellite images have proved otherwise. But there are critical limits to relying entirely on images. For example, we don't know even now if other brawls have taken place or when the soldiers fell into the river (after the June 15 incident). Plus, there are ways of tricking satellites too.While satellite blackouts are virtually unheard of (though there was an instance in 2006 when a member of the US House intelligence committee claimed that Chinese lasers had blacked out a US satellite), Col. Vinayak Bhat, a satellite imagery expert, says there is a good chance that Chinese troops may have even used camouflage tents or ground-colored tents so satellites will not be able to zoom in on those. The pink tents which stand out in the bleak high altitude snow desert, he believes, are meant to announce the Chinese presence to the world. Satellite images have the power to disallow everything we've been told about the standoff.

Two brothers struggling to pull a sinking party along.Two days earlier, five of Rashtriya Janata Dal’s eight members of the legislative council had switched over to Nitish Kumar’s Janata Dal-United (JD-U). The development may now divest former chief minister Rabri Devi of her status of leader of the opposition in the upper house.This is not the first time the RJD has faced such a crisis. In February 2014, 13 RJD MLAs were identified as a separate bloc in the assembly. Enraged, party boss Lalu led RJD MPs, MLAs, MLCs and supporters took to Patna’s roads, shouting slogans and marching to the Bihar Legislature Building where then assembly speaker Udai Narayan Choudhary had recognised the rebel MLAs as a separate bloc. The RJD chief then took a rickshaw to the Governor’s House, grabbing eyeballs as well as the attention of TV cameras. By converting his protest into a public spectacle, Lalu the master politician, was able to play victim to perfection, hammering home the message that he was being wronged.With Lalu still in judicial custody and unlikely to be released to campaign in the upcoming Bihar election, the responsibility to fire the party’s engine once again rests on the shoulders of leader of the opposition Tejashwi. However, unlike his father, Tejashwi has meekly accepted the defection of the RJD MLCs. He did condemn it as part of Nitish Kumar’s “constructive work”, but did not create any hullaballoo over it or address a press conference. RJD supporters in private admit to being baffled by Tejashwi’s rather token criticism of the MLC switchover. “We are surprised how and why Tejashwi has been so unlike Lalu on this issue,” says an RJD leader. “This was an opportunity to play victim; instead, he seems to have let it go. Surely, if the leader of the opposition did not protest on the roads, it was not for the sake of social distancing. After all, they were out on the roads to protest the rising fuel prices only a day later.”As Bihar inches toward the assembly election, the two brothers seem to be saddled with the twin burden of matching up to their father’s political acumen and trying to shake off the ills that plagued the RJD governments led by their parents, Lalu as well as Rabri, both chief ministers who led successive governments from 1990 to 2005.“The RJD lost its government a decade before the two brothers made their political debut in 2015. It is unfair to blame Tejashwi and Tej Pratap for the mistakes committed during the regimes of Lalu Prasad and Rabri Devi. But such is the strength of public perception that many who never voted for Lalu and Rabri may still eschew RJD under the two brothers,” says an RJD leader.To be fair to Tejashwi, the young leader of the opposition has made many attempts to gain a foothold in Bihar’s politics. From tying up with smaller allies such as Jitan Ram Manjhi’s Hindustani Awam Morcha (HAM), Mukesh Sahani’s Vikassheel Insaan Party (VIP) and Upendra Kushwaha’s Rashtriya Lok Samta Party (RLSP) in the 2019 Lok Sabha election to picking more Extremely Backward Class and Scheduled Caste leaders to head the party’s district units this year, Tejashwi has tried to expand the party’s social base in Bihar. Many, however, have criticised these measures as simplistic and tantamount to applying band-aid when the need of the hour is deeper surgery.The larger challenge for Tejashwi is to unyoke the party from its not-so-illustrious past, which for many is synonymous with an era of lawlessness. Despite his best efforts, Lalu’s chosen heir has not been able to project a new image for the RJD going into the election toward the year-end.“Facts are facts. Let’s face the reality. The RJD, with its traditional M-Y voter base of 16.5 per cent Muslims and 14 per cent Yadavs, is no doubt formidable, but in a rainbow coalition, it is also a vulnerability, as other potential support groups such as the Kushwahas, Dalits and Mallahs baulk at the prospect of supporting a formation where the M-Y bloc is dominant. The M-Y vote-bank can be decisive in a triangular or four-cornered contest, but in a bipolar contest, which Bihar seems to be heading for, it is just not enough to swing the election,” a senior JD-U leader explains.In the general election last year, while the RJD expected Kushwaha votes from the RLSP, Mallah votes from VIP and Dalit votes from HAM (S), the three smaller parties were also depending on the RJD for a large chunk of votes. As RJD—as well as the three smaller parties--failed to win even a single seat, Tejashwi seemed to have switched to a new 'Do It Yourself' strategy. The RJD is now likely to contest at least 150 of the 243 assembly seats in Bihar.As swift and dramatic his rise to power has been by virtue of being Lalu’s son, it’s also a huge liability. The task is made harder because Tejashwi lacks the charisma and connect with voters that his father had, which helped the RJD win successive elections from 1990 to 2005.RJD supporters still argue it’s no pushover. Over the years, the party’s core vote base has never deserted its patriarch Lalu, irrespective of the series of electoral, political and legal reverses. Yet, it had to team up with Nitish Kumar’s JD(U) in 2015, which delivered additional votes to the party, and took its tally to 44 per cent in the seats it contested. The RJD had also emerged as the single-largest party in the Bihar assembly then. The party still retains the status, but it was largely undermined after it failed to win even a single Lok Sabha seat in the 2019 general election. It had to concede leads to the NDA in 73 of the 80 assembly segments it won in 2015.Perhaps this explains why the RJD has been walking the extra mile to add new social groups to its kitty. As though this was not enough of a challenge, the Covid crisis has made things worse, casting a shadow over the mode of campaigning.Subscribe to the daily newsletter for sharp insights delivered straight to your inbox https://www.indiatoday.in/newsletter"
https://www.indiatoday.in/india-today-insight/story/what-next-for-the-class-of-2020-1695676-2020-07-01,2020-07-01 01:05:00,What next for the class of 2020? | India Today Insight," After months of anticipation, speculation and uncertainty, the Central Board of Secondary Education (CBSE) on June 25 finally informed the Supreme Court that Class 10 and Class 12 exams, scheduled between July 1 and July 15, stand cancelled. Soon after, the Indian Certificate of Secondary Education (ICSE) made a similar announcement. While the decisions made parents and students heave a sigh of relief considering the continuing rise of Covid cases, it also left them with several unanswered questions and doubts.What Has ChangedThe CBSE clarified that students of both Class 10 and 12, who have completed all their exams, will be assessed on their performance in these exams. For students, who appeared for more than three subjects, the average of the marks obtained in the best three subjects will be awarded. For those who could only take three exams, the average of the marks in the best two subjects will be taken. And the Class 12 students who could only sit for one or two exam will be assessed on the basis of their marks in those subjects and their performance in the internal or practical exams and project assignments. The CBSE has also given the students an option to appear for the pending examinations at a later date—yet to be announced—to improve their performance. The ICSE has not given any such option.“There was no other option viable in this situation. The safety of the students is paramount in these difficult times. The decision, with its pros and cons, has to be considered as the best one in the current scenario,” says Ritu Sharma, principal, Delhi Public School, Nagpur. Yet, the decision will have its own share of problems and will be perceived differently by each of the stakeholders involved—students, parents, schools, universities, educators, governments and even international organisations. “This might be overwhelming for students of Class 12 as they are still unsure about the university admissions process, and there will certainly be changes to how the universities will be assessing candidates,” says Eesha Bagga, director (partnerships and alliances), Mindler, a career counselling firm.The Good, the BadSome students will benefit from this process, but some will be hurt. Students who have lost their preparation momentum and are apprehensive about restarting the examination process, and parents (especially those whose children are in boarding schools) who have been worried about sending their children to distant Centres, are probably relieved with this decision. On the other hand, students who expected to do well and for whom the marks awarded by their schools (based on their past performance) could end up being lower than what they would have earned in the board exams, will probably be worried.Though CBSE students can undertake an improvement exam later, many fear their current low scores may impact college admissions. “Usually, the school tends to give lower marks in the internal tests compared to what the children score in their board exams to motivate students to study harder for boards. So, these are the concerns that would affect students with regards to the marks they score,” says Pramath Raj Sinha, founder and chairman, Harappa Education, an online learning education institution.ALSO READ | India's best colleges Will it impact college admissions?Most experts say colleges and universities must restructure the admission process to offer a level playing field to all students. The high cut-off percentages, especially in universities in Delhi and Mumbai, and other state universities, will be a matter of concern. But since CBSE has already suggested a metric for assessment, it will certainly be considered by the universities when deciding the cut-off percentages for the forthcoming admission cycle. The best course of action for the universities would be to work in tandem with CBSE and other state boards in order to come up with efficient and suitable alternatives.Manit Jain, chairman, FICCI Arise, and co-founder and director of the Heritage Group of Schools, says, ""We all understand that one-time examination is never a fair measure of a student's ability and potential. However, considering the high stakes that the board examination results carry and the efforts students put in for it, it is important for universities and institutions to be sensitive to the children and establish admission criteria that consider consistency in performance through the year along with the board results. In order to ensure minimum impact on studentsre-evaluating the admission processes will be a huge saviour for many.""There are primarily three ways in which universities in India conduct admissions—based on merit, on entrance exams and by profile. For merit-based admissions, the universities consider a candidate’s results in Class 10 and 12; for entrance-based, they have a specific exam that is an integral part of the admission procedure; and for profile-based, universities do a holistic purview of a student's profile. Though the new evaluation pattern for board exams is the best possible alternative in the current situation, it is not quite fair. Therefore, whenever the colleges take admissions, it is likely that merit would be evaluated on the basis of entrance exams alone.""Now, the universities that were looking at admissions based on entrances, profiles or interviews will not be affected in a significant manner as the board results formed only a part of their process and were not the sole determinant. The concern arises in cases of universities that were only accepting candidates based on their board merit,” says Bagga.Other experts suggest a combination of a variety of criteria, including performance of students through the year, performance portfolios, statements of purpose and group interactions. Universities must also review their cut-off scores for admission to several courses. “The minimum marks criterion for eligibility to various entrance examinations must be reviewed,” suggests Jain.What about entrance examinations?After the cancellation of board exams, candidates are expecting the National Testing Authority (NTA) to either postpone or cancel Joint Entrance Examinations (JEE) Main and National Eligibility cum Entrance Test (NEET). ""NEET and JEE don’t use board marks directly and they are only used as qualifying criteria. If students want to get into an IIT, about 75 per cent marks in the boards is a good criterion. The postponement of these exams will negatively affect student morale,” says Saurabh Kumar, director academics, Vidyamandir Classes. However, the conducting authority has not released any official notice on NEET and JEE postponement yet. Considering the increasing number of cases in India, it is highly expected that the NTA will conduct JEE Main and NEET as scheduled in August. There has been a proposal to conduct NEET in online and offline mode in a staggered manner to avoid crowding at the exam centres. However, the NTA has told the Kerala High Court that NEET cannot be conducted in online mode.While there would hopefully be more clarity from the authorities in the coming days about assessment and admission, experts suggests that this crisis should be used as an opportunity to accelerate reforms. “This is the time to move towards a more evolved version of college admission, which depends on aptitude and match to the course,” says Akshay Chaturvedi, founder and CEO, Leverage Edu, educational consultants.Subscribe to the daily newsletter for sharp insights delivered straight to your inbox https://www.indiatoday.in/newsletter"

https://www.indiatoday.in/india-today-insight/story/the-covid-canvas-1695679-2020-07-01,2020-07-01 01:05:00,The Covid canvas | India Today Insight," How do couples behave in these dark times? Artist Jogen Chowdhury's Couple in pen-and-ink shows a nude pair sitting on their haunches with their backs to the world. The woman looks pensive, eyes down; the man seems confused. The spines of the characters resemble roots, branching out as ribs and sticking out of the undernourished flesh. The skin is cracked, like arid land waiting for the rains. The heavily fragmented texture of the nude couple, as if they were in fishnet costumes, reminds one of life caught in a net (as in Covid times).Lockdown, home-bound migrants, job loss, hunger and the woes of living with a pandemic have caused a creative churn all over the world. In Bengal too, artists have taken up the brush and easel to depict life unfolding in its various grim shades.Four such artists--Jogen Chowdhury, Arunima Choudhury, Anjan Modak and Soma Das--have gifted the world some memorable paintings, a documentation of this abnormal time and its socio-economic fallout. Curated by Emami Art at its gallery, the works titled Couple, Migrants, Privacy in Confined Life and Dream of Reality are the artists' take on the different layers of Covid.The pandemic, apart from causing heavy casualties at a macrocosmic level, has caused upheaval and disruption in a microcosmic sense too. Individual lives suffer and losses could be anything from the trivial, like a loss of privacy, as reflected in Soma's work, to something more frightfully gruesome: loss of sanity, loss of livelihood and even close relations.Arunima's confident strokes, suffused with moss green, yellow ochre and a palette of vegetable dyes in Migrants is an extension of the ‘Displacement’ series she took up in 2015, inspired by photographers Allen Teller and Jerri Zbiral and the ‘Following the Box’ project of the pictures they had discovered of Bengal in 1945. The war refugees of Syria, Iraq, and closer to home, the Rohingya from Myanmar, made Arunima take up the subject of dislocation again. No surprise then that her canvas tells the harrowing story of migrants embarking on a forced homeward journey, thrust upon them by an unplanned lockdown. Arunima Choudhury's painting.Anjan Modak's work in watercolour and graphite is far more subtle. A terrified woman is seen cradling a frightened bird. Man and bird look trapped inside a small hut-like structure, too tiny to hold their figures inside. ""The fear in the eyes is that of an uncertain future. I have combined Covid and cyclone to create this element of fear. The moon in the sky resembles a half-eaten chapati. The picture of the rotis strewn around the Aurangabad railway tracks after the migrants got mowed down haunted me,"" Anjan says. Anjan Modak's painting.The claustrophobic atmosphere of the lockdown is expressed with sensitivity and pathos in Soma's portrayal of life in the stifling slums where a woman, for want of privacy, can be seen crouching in the space under her bed-stead to change her clothes. Using gouache on acid-free paper, the artist has used shades of pink and blue to balance the morose expression in the woman's face. The picture is a mockery of the term ‘social distancing’; in the slums, people live like cattle in their pens. Soma Das's painting.The four artists uphold four different aspects of the coronavirus but as a whole, they weave the story of a time. Life imitates Art more than Art imitates life,’ or so wrote Oscar Wilde. Perhaps because of this inter-dependence and the ability to inspire, influence and sustain each other, the line separating art and life often merges. If art as a mirror of life helps us to see and understand our journey in life better, the latter feeds on art to shape and improve itself. The pandemic had just raised its ugly head when the United Nations requested artists to share ""concise and impactful visuals to help share life-saving information on COVID-19"". Many artists threw in their hats, but the picture of a nurse with folded hands and the caption, ‘Bless the Healers’, was adjudged the most powerful in communicating the message.Here too the message is clear: people are waiting to break free of Covid.Subscribe to the daily newsletter for sharp insights delivered straight to your inbox https://www.indiatoday.in/newsletter"

Released in 1995, Coolie No 1 is the first film in the No 1 series.

In many of these films, Karisma Kapoor played the lead female part.Coolie No 1 is being remade by the director with his son, Varun Dhawan, and Sara Ali Khan.

It was earlier scheduled to release on May 1 this year, but as theatres remained shut due to the novel coronavirus pandemic, the makers decided to postpone its release.ALSO READ | Govinda celebrates 21 years of Haseena Maan Jaayegi with throwback pics: Main kya bhadhaai hoALSO READ | Karisma Kapoor turns 46: Kareena Kapoor shares a montage of old videos and pics to wish LoloALSO READ | Little boy dances to Govinda's hit songs in crazy viral video.

It'll be pretty straightforward to see a spectacular point and there'll be no applause in the way.""So that certainly will affect the players.

Some users on Tuesday had reported that they were unable to log in due to some technical error. The developers were quick to rectify the error and announced that the services of the app has gone back to being normal.“Setu is back!!” The Twitter handle of Aarogya Setu posted after the glitch was rectified.Informing the users about the glitch, Aarogya Setu had earlier tweeted from their official handle, “Some users have reported login errors on #AarogyaSetu. Our technical teams are on the job. We will be back soon. Sorry for the inconvenience.”In another tweet, Aarogya Setu ensured that all user data is safe. “The tech teams ensured that Setu is back to doing what it does the best - Keeping You Safe!! And yes, all user data is safe!!,” the twitter handle of the app tweeted.Incidentally, the snag in the Aarogya Setu app appears a day after the Indian government banned 59 Chinese apps including TikTok, UC Browser and others due to some security and privacy reasonsComing back to COVID-tracing apps, Google and Apple have updated their phones and software with an inbuilt exposure notification tool that can be used to track Covid-19 patients, and their contacts. However, to use the tool you will have to install an authorized app by the government that can send Exposure NotificationsThe government of India has its own COVID tracing app, Aarogya Setu but that it is incompatible with the Google-Apple API for contact tracing and therefore the feature available in the smartphones cannot be used now. There are a couple of differences in Google-Apple’s API and the Setu App. The feature by Google and Apple allows contact tracing apps to use Bluetooth to make the contact tracing more effective whereas the Aarogya Setu requires information such as the location of users and their contacts for contact tracing to work effectively.Google and Apple on the other hand are not in favour of collecting the location details of the users for contact tracing because the APIs for this feature are designed to collect data anonymously and create random IDs, which are exchanged with other devices to facilitate contact tracing. So as far as policies are concerned, Google-Apple and Aarogya Setu are not on the same page. Setu app can’t use Google-Apple API unless it is modified by the government and approved by Google and Apple.ALSO READ | TikTok, US Web, Shareit, Mi Video Call and over 50 other Chinese apps banned by India: Full list hereALSO READ | Amazon announces 20,000 jobs in India: Here is how you can applyALSO READ | Controversy around Hindu gods lands Netflix in a soup, boycott hashtag trends"

DoT will look at overall security for both telcos and ISPs and that is why the larger list,” a source familiar with the matter told ET.On Tuesday evening, there was confusion if the service providers had taken TikTok down as it showed a “network error” and “no internet connection.” TikTok was made unavailable on Google Play Store and Apple App Store since Tuesday morning.Some sources told ET that TikTok’s parent company ByteDance had voluntarily taken the site down. However, there was no confirmation.The 59 Chinese apps including TikTok, SHAREit, and WeChat were listed for a ban by the government days after the Galwan valley clash on June 15 in which 20 Indian soldiers lost their lives. The government has said that the applications are engaged in activities “prejudicial to sovereignty and integrity of India, defence of India, security of state and public order.”""The Ministry of Information Technology, invoking it's power under section 69A of the Information Technology Act read with the relevant provisions of the Information Technology (Procedure and Safeguards for Blocking of Access of Information by Public) Rules 2009 and in view of the emergent nature of threats has decided to block 59 apps since in view of information available they are engaged in activities which is prejudicial to sovereignty and integrity of India, defence of India, security of state and public order,"" the order said.ALSO READ: | After ban, TikTok now stops working in India and shows internet errorALSO READ: | Do you have TikTok, other banned Chinese apps on your phone?

Ankita recently posted a picture with Milind from their old vacation and shared what travelling actually means for her.View this post on InstagramTravel has always been my favourite activity and I miss it the most ! Travel really transforms you to be a better version of yourself. When I say travel, I don’t mean a planned trip put together by a travel company. I mean packing your bag and setting out to actually experience everything local in your expected destination. Letting your guard down so you can learn something new, gather more experiences so it can mould you into a better wiser person. Letting yourself feel absolutely out of place so that you can explore something new about yourself and find yourself all over again. Yes, I miss THAT feeling.

https://www.indiatoday.in/magazine/up-front/story/20200706-the-elusive-miracle-drug-1693109-2020-06-28,2020-06-29 10:48:00,The Elusive Miracle Drug,"Rudra Govind runs a pharmacy in Delhi's Shahdara. He remembers the rush for hydroxychloroquine in April when the ICMR (Indian Council of Medical Research) announced it as a possible prophylactic-his stock sold out within two days. Predictably, there is a similar surge in demand for two new Covid drugs-Favipiravir and Remdesivir-as they enter the market.Since news broke on June 21 that pharmaceutical company Glenmark's Favipiravir formulation FabiFlu had been cleared by the DCGI (Drug Controller General of India) for 'restricted emergency use' in 'mild to moderate cases', Govind has received daily enquiries about the medicine. It didn't seem to matter that Favipiravir, like Remdesivir before it, was not a guaranteed treatment for Covid.""People just hear 'new Covid cure' and think there is new hope, better recovery prospects,"" says Dr T. Narayanan, president of the Indian Pharmaceutical Association. But to think of these new drugs as 'cures' elides the caveat that ""they have not been found to be effective in severe cases-the stage at which inflammation and thrombosis become hard to treat"". 'Mild to moderate' cases, which account for the bulk of Covid positives, typically have a high likelihood of recovering on their own.Favipiravir and Remdesivir target different phases of the disease-the former is for mild to moderate (but not on oxygen) cases while the latter is for moderate cases on oxygen support. According to the latest clinical management guidelines issued by the health ministry, 'mild' patients include those with uncomplicated respiratory tract infections and attendant fever, cough and sore throat. 'Moderate' cases include those with pneumonia but no sign of severe disease; for adults, this can manifest in breathlessness and an oxygen saturation of 90-94 per cent on room air. Anything below 90 per cent is worrisome as many patients are susceptible to a sneaky onset of hypoxia. Once Covid infects the lining of air sacs in the lungs, pro-inflammatory chemicals are released at the site to inhibit the virus. Inflammation of this delicate lung lining causes it to thicken, resulting in a drop in blood oxygen levels. The body then compensates by gradually increasing the breathing rate. This also results in release of additional carbon dioxide in the body, the build-up of which would normally alert one's brain to falling oxygen levels, which could be well below 80 or less before one starts to feel visibly breathless, suddenly bringing to light the severity of the infection. Moderate cases thus need to be monitored, and are often advised to be on precautionary oxygen support.Favipiravir will be sold as FabiFlu in India and will be manufactured domestically, including the APIs (active pharmaceutical ingredients) needed for it. The recommended course is 1,800 mg on day one, followed by 800 mg a day for up to 13 days. Each tablet is 200 mg, which would mean nine tablets on day one, and four tablets daily thereafter. Priced at Rs 103 a pop, a 14-day course would cost around Rs 6,695. ""It is certainly not the most affordable drug at the moment, especially if it is only to treat mild to moderate symptoms,"" says Malini Aisola, co-convenor of the All India Drug Action Network. In India, two more trials for the drug are ongoing-pharmaceutical company Cipla and the CSIR (Council of Scientific and Industrial Research), are conducting a randomised trial. On June 24, CSIR expressed intentions of increasing the size of its Favipiravir study to around 600-700 people. Covid barrier: Remdesivir is being used to treat moderate cases on oxygen supportOn the other hand, Remdesivir, licensed to five companies in India by patent holder Gilead, is administered to moderate cases on oxygen support or those experiencing breathlessness. It is an intravenous drug, since a patient on oxygen cannot swallow pills. A randomised trial by Gilead, on 600 patients, concluded that those on a five-day course had a 65 per cent chance of showing clinical improvement by day 11 as opposed to those not given the drug. Remdesivir is to be sold at around Rs 5,000-6,000 per vial, and the cost of a five-day treatment would be around Rs 30,000. ""It is still an experimental drug, but if it does improve moderate cases, it would be a crucial barrier to prevent the onset of severe symptoms,"" says Dr Suresh Kumar, director of LNJP (Lok Nayak Jai Prakash Narayan) Hospital, Delhi. Tocilizumab is another experimental drug recommended for moderate cases, as it has shown signs of halting the cytokine storms that lead to inflammation.Halting the progression of the disease to severe pneumonia or acute respiratory distress is important. Once the virus starts infecting the lining of the lungs, causing inflammation and, sometimes, blood clots, chances of recovery start to reduce. There are very few drugs being used in India at the moment for such cases. Plasma therapy is in its trial phase and is administered only on an emergency basis. There is hope, however, in the world's oldest steroid-dexamethasone. ""This is the first drug to show a reduction in mortality,"" says Dr Narayanan. In an Oxford University trial, about 2,000 hospital patients were given dexamethasone and the results were compared with 4,000 patients who were not. For those on ventilators, it cut the risk of death from 40 to 28 per cent, and for those needing oxygen, from 25 to 20 per cent. However, the long-term effects of steroids remain a concern and these are not recommended for diabetics, who, in India, account for many severe cases.As repurposed drugs are approved for use in India, there are three important things to bear in mind. One, experimental treatments should not be confused with guaranteed cures. Two, India must formulate a protocol for informed consent before administering these new drugs. This is also recommended by the WHO (World Health Organization) and we are yet to devise a mechanism for compassionate use of medicine. Three, data must be shared on priority. At the World Health Assembly 2019, India adopted a resolution for data transparency. And yet, the data, on the basis of which drugs are cleared, has not been shared by the DCGI. ""The public has a right to know on what basis a drug has [been considered] to show efficacy and has been approved,"" says Dr C.S. Pramesh, director of Tata Memorial Hospital in Mumbai.With over 9 million Covid cases around the world, and over 450,000 in India alone, there is a desperate longing for a miracle drug. Trials that would usually take a year to complete are now being conducted and finished in a matter of months. Global sharing of data is in everybody's interest-for the public to make an informed choice and for the medical community to understand the potential benefits and risks associated with every new drug."

Unwilling to compromise in the latter half of his career, the actor finally said yes to a part in Netflix's Bulbbul.Q. Bulbbul marks your original streaming debut...I have been offered around 80 OTT projects. Of them, only 10 made it to the scripting stage. I dismissed 50 after hearing the log line. You can smell a shoddy project from a mile away. I have only said yes to another series and have a generous guest appearance in another one.Q. So what convinced you to do Bulbbul?I have always used five parameters to decide if I do a film or not-the story, the character I'm playing, if the character drives the story, who my co-actors are, and who the director is. With a first-time director you can't be sure, so I look for vision and passion. Anvita Dutt had both.Q. You may come across as a snob to some with those parameters.In this second half of my life, I'm not willing to compromise. You just have to be on social media to see how stupid some people on social media are, and that stupidity makes them see you as a snob just because you say 'No' to bad work. They should be thankful there are artists saying 'No', so they are not subjected to torture.Q. You have worked on a domestic violence public service campaign during lockdownI consider it to be something I would gladly do any day of the year, lockdown or no lockdown. Public service initiatives come and go, but it's the long-haul philanthropy that tests your resilience and character.Q. Is there anything this lockdown has taught you?It has been pretty horrific and challenging to see what the country is going through. People just trying to go home is not something you would have envisaged as being such a human tragedy. Each of those images is a terrible mirror to where we have reached and who we are."

Drones, fitted with insecticide sprayers, have been approved by the Union agriculture ministry for use in locust control. Two states, worst-affected Rajasthan and Madhya Pradesh, have started employing these flying machines.On June 22, the ministry's Locusts Warning Organisation (LWO) pressed into service nine drones in the districts of Jaisalmer, Barmer, Bikaner and Nagaur in Rajasthan. A similar exercise has been carried out in Shivpuri district of Madhya Pradesh.Spraying insecticide with drones, officials say, could prove to be effective against locusts. Conventionally, locust attacks are tackled with tractor-mounted insecticide sprayers (for vegetation on the ground) and fire engines (for trees and tracts of uninhabited or desert land); such equipment were used in Sri Ganganagar, Jaipur and Ajmer districts of Rajasthan on June 22.The LWO is headquartered in Jodhpur and has 10 Locust Control Offices (LCOs) in the desert areas of Rajasthan and two in Gujarat. In addition, it has set up four temporary offices in Rajasthan and one each in Madhya Pradesh and Uttar Pradesh.Since May, measures to control the locusts have been undertaken over approximately 114,000 hectares of land, spread across 84 districts in Rajasthan, Gujarat, Punjab, Uttar Pradesh, Maharashtra, Madhya Pradesh and Chhattisgarh.How did drones join the anti-locust drive? In January and May, two companies had demonstrated their use at select locations in Rajasthan, and both central and Rajasthan government officials had found the results to be encouraging. In end-May, the agriculture ministry floated tenders and shortlisted five companies for the supply of drones. Consultations were then held with Central Insecticides Board over the protocols to be followed during the spraying. While the Centre alone is permitted to use highly toxic chemicals on uncultivable land, the states are allowed to use a dozen less toxic insecticides on agricultural land.The shortlisted companies will deploy five drones each, totalling 25, in Rajasthan. Twelve have been supplied so far in June. While the companies are providing the drones and the manpower, the insecticides are being supplied by the state government. The Rajasthan government is also negotiating prices with these companies for a contract to supply 30 drones, for later use as per need. The Madhya Pradesh government has asked the drone companies for more demonstrations.""Drones have added a new dimension to locust control and their efficacy in the form of [pest] mortality has been encouraging,"" says Atish Chandra, joint secretary in the Union agriculture ministry.While these drones can cover areas inaccessible to the tractor-mounted sprayers and fire engines, they have limitations as well. ""Drones can carry only 10-20 litres of insecticide [at a time] and cover a maximum area of 10 ha. So they will play only a small role in the overall locust-control operations,"" says Naresh Gangwar, principal secretary (agriculture), Rajasthan. Also, each drone has a flight time of about 15 minutes and needs a recharge or change of battery before the next sortie.To put the overall scale of the exercise in perspective, the Rajasthan government has deployed 2,142 tractors and 46 fire engines to fight locusts. Madhya Pradesh is using 83 tractors and 47 fire-control vehicles; Uttar Pradesh four and 16, respectively; and Punjab 50 and six. Gujarat has deployed 38 tractors. The Centre has put to use 15 of the 60 Micron sprayers sourced from the United Kingdom. Beginning September, the UK firm will start supplying five aerial spray (CD atomiser) kits with GPS trackers. These will be fitted on air force helicopters for aerial spraying against pests."

The wave has been driven by the auteurist visions of directors and producers like Lijo Jose Pellissery and Aashiq Abu, and stories that provide charming, ground-level views of a milieu without sacrificing big-picture commentary. Here are some favourites from the past five years.Ottaal (2014, Netflix)This visually stunning, heart-breaking work is an adaptation of the Chekhov short story Vanka, about an unhappy little boy writing a letter. However, the source text is almost incidental, because this film's beating heart is the terrain in which it unfolds: the Kuttanad backwaters where an eight-year-old minds ducks with his grandfather. The many beautiful images-a boat rowing across a breath-taking network of canals, a ""nameless dog"" running alongside the shore-are markers of a childhood about to end. They help you see how much this boy is part of his setting.Angamaly Diaries (2017, Netflix) Ee. Ma. Yau. (2018, Amazon Prime)[Two films by Lijo Jose Pellissery]If Anurag Kashyap's Gangs of Wasseypur presented small-town gang wars in the format of a multi-generational epic, Pellissery's Angamaly Diaries operates in a more intimate meter. It begins with a catchy folk song, celebrating Kochi's Angamaly suburb, and introduces us to the handsome, somewhat goofy Vincent Pepe who gets in trouble as he rises up the ranks of the local pork trade. This is a film with surprising lightness of touch, even though its piece de resistance is a complex, unbroken 11-minute take with the camera weaving past hundreds of people at a crowded festival.Pellissery also uses many long takes in Ee. Ma. Yau., about a man's increasingly futile efforts to give his father the dignified funeral he had asked for. This is a poignant yet funny portrayal of death-and the rituals and sideshows around death. There is genuine loss and grief, but also marvellous depictions of the more performative aspects of grief; the story moves effortlessly between a droll and a mournful one. It even has a sleuthing priest, who has been asked to perform the last rites but seems to think he is investigating a murder! Thondimuthalum Driksakshiyum (2017, Hotstar) [loosely translated: ""The stolen item and the witness""]One of many low-key Malayalam films that might seem random and diffused, but translate superbly on screen, turning an everyday story into something compelling and multi-layered. A married couple is caught up in the whimsical politics of a small-town police station after a cheeky thief-played by Fahadh Faasil in one of his star-making roles-steals and swallows the woman's gold chain. (""I don't give up till the end. That's how I am,"" the man says, almost bashfully, when unmasked.) Many destinies intersect, character revealed and redemption sought; and in between all this, there is also a terrific chase scene.Sexy Durga (2017)The title of Sanal Kumar Sasidharan's film was changed to S Durga to avoid hurting ""religious sentiments""-which is ironic, given that part of the point it makes is how women are oppressed in a society that adores goddesses. The story centres on the contrast between Durga the goddess and a flesh-and-blood woman terrorised in increasingly unsubtle ways when she and her boyfriend hitch a ride late at night. The film's stylistic decisions-the use of lengthy held shots within a cramped space, for instance-make the viewer feel as discomfited as the protagonists; the ending combines bare-bones realism with the aesthetic of a surreal horror film where society itself is the predatory monster.Sudani from Nigeria (2018, Netflix)A Nigerian footballer, playing for a small Keralite club, is called ""Sudani"" by the locals because that's what they think all Africans are. This cultural disconnect is the precursor to other misunderstandings and barriers that develop between this young man and his manager, especially when the former loses his passport and needs to get back home. No flourishes here, just simple narrative filmmaking done with tremendous heart.Kumbalangi Nights (2019, Amazon Prime)Four brothers live together in an unhygienic little nook of a Kochi village. There are no women in their lives, but that is about to change, and with it will come a new sense of responsibility. But they must also set differences aside and take on a big bad wolf-someone who is ostensibly a responsible ""family man"" but with a psychotic side. The film is effortless in how it unfolds, how every character arc seems organically realised even as it reaches for allegory near the end. One of the triumphs of its year.Trance (2020, Amazon Prime)The most recent film on this list-about a motivational speaker who, haunted by his brother's death, becomes a pawn in the spirituality ""business""-is also an outlier. Most of the other films mentioned here are spare, lean, characterised by storytelling economy; Trance is an audacious work. It looks different too, set in urban environments and featuring men in sharp suits rather than mundus. But that is part of the point, since this is a tale about appearances and the webs we weave to try and take an elevator-rather than a staircase-to the top. Incidentally, there is also a hat-tip to the 1997 sci-fi film Contact."

He was 98.Reiner’s assistant Judy Nagy said he died Monday night of natural causes his home in Beverly Hills, California.He was one of show business’ best liked men, the tall, bald Reiner was a welcome face on the small and silver screens, in Caesar’s 1950s troupe, as the snarling, toupee-wearing Alan Brady of The Dick Van Dyke Show and in such films as The Russians Are Coming, the Russians Are Coming and It’s a Mad, Mad, Mad, Mad World.In recent years, he was part of the roguish gang in the Ocean’s Eleven movies starring George Clooney and appeared in documentaries including Broadway: Beyond the Golden Age” and If You’re Not in the Obit, Eat Breakfast.Films he directed included Oh, God! starring George Burns and John Denver; All of Me, with Steve Martin and Lily Tomlin; and the 1970 comedy “Where’s Poppa?” He was especially proud of his books, including Enter Laughing, an autobiographical novel later adapted into a film and Broadway show; and My Anecdotal Life, a memoir published in 2003. He recounted his childhood and creative journey in the 2013 book, I Remember Me.But many remember Reiner for The Dick Van Dyke Show, one of the most popular television series of all time and a model of ensemble playing, physical comedy and timeless, good-natured wit. It starred Van Dyke as a television comedy writer working for a demanding, eccentric boss (Reiner) and living with his wife (Mary Tyler Moore in her first major TV role) and young son in suburban New Rochelle, New York.""The Van Dyke show is probably the most thrilling of my accomplishments because that was very, very personal,"" Reiner once said.

Details here,"A spy thriller based on former RAW officer RK Yadav's book, Mission R&AW, is currently in the works. The series will focus on Rameshwar Nath Kao, the founder of RAW (Research and Analysis Wing), India's foreign intelligence agency and its role in solving India's disputes with foreign nations.Speaking on his book, RK Yadav said, ""My book gives an insight into the professional acumen of Mr Kao and how RAW came into inception. Besides his many achievements, Kao was also monitoring China during the 1962 war when he was working as then-Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru's PS (personal security chief).""Yadav further added that apart from providing a detailed account of the little-known journey of Kao, his book also chronicles the 1962 war with China and the intelligence-gathering techniques adopted by RAW.""Kao told me that in November 1962, the US had proposed to Jawaharlal Nehru a nuclear action against China, if the conflict escalated. Thereafter Nehru rejected the Chinese proposal of a summit with them and demanded Chinese withdrawal beyond LAC which China had to concede to. The disintegration of Pakistan in 1971 was a joint strategy of Kao and late Field Marshal Sam Manekshaw,"" added Kao.The yet-to-be-titled series will be bankrolled by Bohra Bros, who have produced over 36 movies including Shahid and Gangs of Wasseypur.Sunil Bohra of Bohra Bros revealed that his team has been working on the series for the last two years and it is one of the most challenging projects of his life. “To document the story of RN Kao is by far my life’s most challenging and important project. Our team has been working on this project for the past two years. The book authored by Mr Yadav gives an elaborate account of the founder and India’s foremost intelligence agency,"" he said.Bohra felt turning the book into a film wouldn't have done justice to RN Kao's story. ""Having perused the details, we realised that it would be unfair to encapsulate the astounding story of Kao in merely two hours. Hence, we have decided to make a web series so that justice can be done to the man who we, and our generations to come, all should be proud of,"" he added.A team of experts has been roped in, who'll work on the series, which will be shot in India, China, Bangladesh and the US.Things to expect from the seriesThe espionage thriller will feature many real-life incidents, which includes the infamous sabotage of Kashmir Princess, a chartered aircraft owned by Air India in 1955. It was on its way to Indonesia from India and was damaged mid-air by a bomb explosion and crashed into the South China sea, claiming sixteen lives on board.An investigation led by Kao had revealed that the then-Chinese premier Zhou Enlai, who missed the flight due to a medical emergency was the prime target.The web series will feature the emergence of Indira Gandhi after the sudden death of Lal Bahadur Shastri in Tashkent and her decision to form RAW under the aegis of RN Kao.Another important aspect that the series will capture is the paradigm shift in the intelligence gathering by the agencies post the Sino-Indian war, the 1965 war with Pakistan and the role of R&AW in other international disputes.This will be the first series based on Kao's contribution to the nation and RAW. However, earlier, in January 2020, Karan Johar had announced a film based on the RAW founder, which will be an adaptation of Nitin A Gokhale’s book titled R.N.

The IG did not immediately respond to a request for comment. A Boeing spokesman said the company had taken steps to enhance safety and was committed to transparency. “When the MAX returns to service, it will be one of the most thoroughly scrutinized aircraft in history, and we have full confidence in its safety,” he said.The IG’s report is the latest of reports faulting the plane’s approval, while the Justice Department has an ongoing criminal investigation.The 737 MAX has been grounded from commercial flight worldwide since March 2019 after two crashes killed 346 people in Ethiopia and Indonesia over a five-month span.Boeing’s so-called MCAS stall-prevention system has been faulted in both crashes, when the system repeatedly and forcefully pushed down the jet’s nose as pilots struggled to intervene, among a cocktail of factors pinpointed by crash investigators.The inspector general report details activities from the early phase of the certification process in January 2012 through the second crash. It also details allegations of “undue pressure” from Boeing management on workers handling safety certification, though it adds that all “formally reported” instances of undue pressure were “satisfactorily addressed.”The IG’s office will issue recommendations to the FAA later this year, the Transportation Department said in comments about the draft report submitted on June 8.The FAA is currently evaluating the MCAS upgrades during a series of certification test flights this week that could pave the way for the jet’s return domestically by year end.REGULATORS IN THE DARKIn response to the report, the Transportation Department said the FAA’s certification of the 737 MAX was “hampered by a lack of effective communication” between the agency and U.S. planemaker.Crucially, that included the “incomplete understanding of the scope and potential safety impacts” of changes Boeing made to the jet’s flight control system to give it more power and authority, the agency said.“Boeing did not submit certification documents to FAA detailing the change,” the report said. “FAA flight test personnel were aware of this change, but key FAA certification engineers and personnel responsible for approving the level of airline pilot training told us they were unaware of the revision to MCAS.”The FAA conducted its first-ever detailed review of the system in January 2019, three months after the first crash in Indonesia. The review resulted in documentation that was never finalized, the report said.The report also noted that, after the Indonesia crash, the FAA completed a risk analysis that found that the uncorrected risk to the 737 MAX was 2.68 fatalities per 1 million flight hours, which exceeded the FAA’s risk guidelines of 1 fatality per 10 million flight hours.A December 2018 FAA analysis determined a risk of about 15 accidents occurring over the life of the entire 737 MAX fleet if the software fix was not implemented.After the crashes, Boeing proposed and FAA accepted a redesign of MCAS software that would include additional safeguards against unintended MCAS activation.Boeing also created a Product and Services Safety Organization for employees to raise concerns over safety and undue pressure, first reported by Reuters.Boeing agreed to develop the MCAS software update by April 12 and operators would have until June 18, 2019, to install the software. As Boeing worked on proposed software upgrade for MCAS, a second plane crashed in March 2019 in Ethiopia.Also Read | Covid-19: Boeing slashes 12,000 jobs as virus seizes travel industryAlso Read | Coronavirus shockwave rocks airplane manufacturers, suppliers"

The Inter-Parliamentary Alliance on China, a group of European, Australian, North American, and Japanese politicians from across the political spectrum, demanded an independent U.N. investigation.Politicians around the world have called for a United Nations probe into a Chinese government birth control campaign targeting largely Muslim minorities in the far western region of Xinjiang, even as Beijing said it treats all ethnicities equally under the law.They were referring to an Associated Press investigation published this week that found the Chinese government is taking draconian measures to slash birth rates among Uighurs and other minorities, while encouraging some of the country's Han majority to have more children.The Inter-Parliamentary Alliance on China, a group of European, Australian, North American, and Japanese politicians from across the political spectrum, demanded an independent U.N. investigation.""The world cannot remain silent in the face of unfolding atrocities,"" the group said in a statement.The AP found that the Chinese government regularly subjects minority women in Xinjiang to pregnancy checks and forces intrauterine devices, sterilization and even abortion on hundreds of thousands. New research obtained by The Associated Press in advance of publication by China scholar Adrian Zenz also showed that the hundreds of millions of dollars the government pours into birth control has transformed Xinjiang from one of China's fastest-growing regions to among its slowest in just a few years.The AP found that the population control measures are backed by mass detention both as a threat and as a punishment for failure to comply. Having too many children is a major reason people are sent to detention camps, documents and interviews show, with the parents of three or more ripped away from their families unless they can pay huge fines.The U.S. Commission on International Religious Freedom called for a U.N. and State Department investigation, saying the Chinese government's birth control campaign ""might meet the legal criteria for genocide."" According to a U.N. convention, ""imposing measures intended to prevent births"" with ""intent to destroy, in whole or in part, a national, ethnical, racial or religious group"" is considered evidence of genocide. The last colonial governor of Hong Kong, Chris Patten, told Bloomberg Television that the birth control campaign was ""arguably something that comes within the terms of the UN views on sorts of genocide.""The U.S. Senate Foreign Relations Committee called the forced birth control ""beyond deplorable,"" and said that ""a nation that treats its own people this way should never be considered a great power."" U.S. senators Kirsten Gillibrand and Kamala Harris wrote a letter urging the Trump administration to respond to an ""alarming"" AP investigation, and U.S. Senator Marco Rubio and Representative Ro Khanna also called for action.U.S. President Donald Trump told China President Xi Jinping he was right to build detention camps to house hundreds of thousands of ethnic minorities, according to a new book by former national security adviser John Bolton. However, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said the reports of forced birth control for minorities were ""shocking"" and ""disturbing"" in a statement Monday.""We call on the Chinese Communist Party to immediately end these horrific practices,"" he said.Chinese foreign ministry spokesman Zhao Lijian fired back on Tuesday by calling Pompeo ""a brazen liar,"" saying the Uighur population had more than doubled since 1978 in response to criticism of Xinjiang's birth control policies.""If Mr. Pompeo is telling the truth, how can he explain the big increase in the Uighur population?"" Zhao asked.For decades, Xinjiang's population grew quickly, as minorities enjoyed laxer birth control restrictions than Han Chinese. But in just three years, new measures have caused the birth rate in Xinjiang's Uighur-majority areas to plunge, and it is now well under the national average.Zhao also said the American government had been responsible for ""genocide, racial segregation and assimilation policies"" on Native Americans. on them."" University of Colorado researcher Darren Byler said the Chinese state-orchestrated assault on Xinjiang's minorities does echo past birth control programs.""It recalls the American eugenics movement which targeted Native and African Americans up until the 1970s,"" he said. ""China's public health authorities are conducting a mass experiment in targeted genetic engineering on Turkic Muslim populations.""In response to the AP story, which he called ""fake news,"" Zhao said the government treats all ethnicities equally and protects their legal rights. Chinese officials have said in the past that the new measures are merely meant to be fair, with the law now allowing minorities and China's Han majority the same number of children.However, the AP's reporting found that while equal on paper, in practice Han Chinese are largely spared the abortions, sterilizations, IUD insertions and detentions for having too many children that are forced on Xinjiang's other ethnicities, interviews and data show. Some rural minorities are punished even for having the three children allowed by the law.British members of Parliament debated Xinjiang in the House of Commons on Monday, with both Labor and Conservative politicians urging the U.K. Foreign Ministry to adopt a stronger stance against the Chinese government. Nigel Adams, the British Minister of State for Asia, said the reports added to the U.K.'s ""concern about the human rights situation in Xinjiang"" and that it will be ""considering this report very carefully."" Australian Foreign Minister Marise Payne also told Australian broadcaster SBS that the reports ""further compounded"" their concerns.Bill Browder, CEO of investment fund Hermitage Capital Management and brainchild of the Magnitsky Act, asked the U.S. government to level sanctions against Chinese officials, calling the birth control campaign part of a broader assault he called ""vile persecution.""MORE | Facebook staffers walk out, say Trump's posts should be reined inVIDEO | George Floyd death: Miami police kneel to express solidarity with protesters"

ByteDance's hugely popular video-streaming app TikTok is among 59, mostly Chinese, ones banned by New Delhi on national security concerns.It significantly narrows a top growth market for Chinese technology firms and may embolden other governments to shut them out. But the network effects could be messy all around.Giants from Alibaba to Xiaomi have made significant inroads on the subcontinent. For Beijing-based ByteDance, India has been the biggest driver of TikTok installs, accounting for 611 million downloads, or 30% of the total, according to SensorTower. Cutting off new users, and existing ones as they try to install updates, will sting its mooted valuation of $110 billion. And the company faces a similar backlash in the United States where lawmakers are also suspicious about Beijing's access to consumer data.Monday's ban will raise pressure on TikTok's new boss, former Disney executive Kevin Mayer, to make a clean break from its Chinese parent.For now, Chinese companies are slightly safer as investors in home-grown Indian peers. Notably, the blacklist excludes the country's most valuable startups, including the $16 billion payments giant Paytm, backed by Ant Financial, as well as education star Byju's, which counts Tencent as an investor. In total, 18 of India's 30 unicorns have Chinese funding, Gateway House, a Mumbai-based thinktank reckons. But new investment rules and rising anti-China sentiment may slow the overall flow of capital from the People's Republic and that will hurt growth.The sovereign nature of the ban will make it hard to reverse and may embolden others to act against Beijing, which is busy picking fights from the South China Sea all the way to Australia and Canada. The U.S backlash against telecoms equipment maker Huawei, for example, has spread globally. And politicians in India, Italy and beyond have all raised the wall to Chinese capital in recent months. The immediate danger is a retaliation beyond cyberspace: India depends on China for hard-to-substitute imports - active pharmaceutical ingredients, for example. The military and virtual brawl will spill over to other realms.Also read | World of Chinese apps and Indian ban over privacy, security | 10 quick pointsWatch | India bans 59 Chinese apps including Tik Tok"

Of them, 4,403 responded and adequate data of 3,667 was available for analysis.""In our HCW cohort, 539 of the 3,667 participants (14.7 per cent) had flu-like symptoms.

The new coronavirus uses these formations to stick to the human cells and infect them.In their pre-print study, which is not yet peer-reviewed, the researchers noted that the mutation in the new coronavirus is giving it more spikes, which help it get into the host cells more easily.That said, the new mutation, called D614G, doesn't seem to cause more severity among the patients nor is it likely to have an impact on the vaccines under development.New Strain More InfectiousThe mutation, the study noted, ""appears to be more transmissible without resulting in a major observable difference in disease severity"".Scientists involved in the discovery of D614G analysed samples collected from Europe and the US.""...a few mutations can result in the virus changing and what we're always watching out for is any change that changes the clinical impact of the disease,"" World Health Organisation Executive Director Michael J Ryan earlier said.At this moment, the major consequence of this mutation is limited to the transmission rate of the virus and not the severity, the scientists noted.In an interview to The Washington Post, the lead researcher, Dr Hyeryun Choe, reported that the mutation ""made the virus 10 times more infectious in the lab experiment"".The study, published on the pre-print server BioRxiv, argues that higher levels of functional spike proteins possibly increase ""the chance of host-to-host transmission, but other factors limit the rate and efficiency of intra-host replication"".The scientists don't see it impacting the antibody behaviour.According to the WHO, there are more than 49,000 full genome sequences that are available. ""As this is an RNA virus, there are expected changes in them and we're trying to determine if those changes have any impact on the way that this virus behaves. We haven't seen that yet but we have a group of people globally who are looking at this,"" the WHO technical lead on Covid-19, Dr Maria Van Kerkhove, told reporters in Geneva last week.READ | Coronavirus: India not in community transmission, says ICMR chiefALSO READ | ICMR releases sero-survey results, says no community transmission yet but large population at risk of Covid-19ALSO READ | Explained: Community transmission of Covid-19 and where India standsWATCH | MHA issues guidelines prohibiting people's movement across India"

The World Health Organisation (WHO) says identifying and understanding the origin of coronavirus pandemic is key to an effective fight against ravaging Covid-19. And, at such a moment, the discovery of a new virus in China has triggered heightened concerns among the health experts.The new viral strand is another flu virus that has the potential to become a pandemic. This virus is carried by pigs and researchers believe it can infect humans. It can mutate and spread easily through human-to-human transmission, much like coronavirus pandemic.According to a research paper published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, an American journal, the new virus is similar to the Swine Flu virus detected during the 2009 outbreak. That virus had been named A/H1N1pgm09. This one has been named as G4-EA H1N1.The virus is similar but not same and may pose the threat of being a completely new pathogen to humans. Swine Flu pandemic did not turn out to be the kind of threat that experts had initially estimated.Later, they attributed to its similarity to existing influenza viruses. This is why the vaccination against Swine Flu is covered under the existing flu vaccines.But in this case, the scientists have identified the new virus as among the top disease threats. People don't have immunity for a wholly new disease. Ongoing coronavirus pandemic is a deadly proof to that.""serological surveillance among occupational exposure population showed that 10.4% (35/338) of swine workers were positive for G4 EA H1N1 virus, especially for participants 18 y to 35 y old, who had 20.5% (9/44) seropositive rates, indicating that the predominant G4 EA H1N1 virus has acquired increased human infectivity,"" the research said.They warned further saying, ""Such infectivity greatly enhances the opportunity for virus adaptation in humans and raises concerns for the possible generation of pandemic viruses.""""Controlling the prevailing G4 EA H1N1 viruses in pigs and close monitoring in human populations, especially the workers in the swine industry, should be urgently implemented,"" the scientists have recommended.Though the researchers believe the virus is not an immediate threat to human health but it can grow and multiply very fast in the respiratory tract --- nose to lungs - of humans. Their fear is not misplaced given that they have found evidence of recent infection in the swine industry abattoirs in China.Incidentally, some Chinese researchers warned that coronavirus pandemic may be followed with another similar health crisis. Discovery of new virus in China has come at a time when the WHO is preparing to send a team to that country to investigate origin of coronavirus pandemic that has infected more than 1 crore people and claimed more than 5 lakh lives.Read | Covid-19: All coronavirus updatesAlso read | Unlock 2.0 guidelines: Gyms, schools remain closed; night curfew relaxed, more domestic flights soonWatch | MHA releases Unlock 2.0 guidelines: More activities outside containment zones opened up"

The research paper has been published online in a science journal.Aim of study: Rainfall changes in IndiaThis study analyzes and forecasts the long-term spatio-temporal changes in rainfall for the whole of the country using 115 years data (1901 to 2015).It also predicts rainfall change up to 2035 and has investigated the causes of the changes in rainfall pattern across India.The team used Sen’s innovative method to calculate the trend for seasonal rainfall (winter, summer, monsoon and post-monsoon) in thirty-four meteorological sub-divisions of the country.The Artificial Neural Network-Multilayer Perceptron (ANN-MLP) was employed to forecast the rainfall across India.Study on rainfall trends in IndiaCo-author & corresponding author of the research paper Prof. Atiqur Rahman of the Department of Geography, JMI said that the present study showed increasing rainfall trend during 1901-1950, but significant decline of rainfall was observed after 1951. A significant decline in the rainfall during monsoon season is observed at most of the meteorological divisions of India. The overall annual and seasonal variability of rainfall was highest in the sub-divisions of Western India, while the lowest variability was found in Eastern and North India.Almost all of the sub-divisions have detected the negative trend and high variability after 1970. The overall annual and seasonal rainfall at the sub-divisions of North-East, South and Eastern India has observed significant negative trend, while the sub-divisions like Sub-Himalayan Bengal, Gangetic Bengal, Jammu & Kashmir, Konkan & Goa, Madhya Pradesh, Maharastra and Marathwada have recorded positive trend.In addition, the rainfall forecasting for 2030 showed an expected decline to a tune of about 15% in the overall rainfall of India.Relevance of study The present study is quite significant in the age of climate change, where the whole world including India is experiencing a change in rainfall pattern. India’s economy is substantially dependent on agriculture, which in turn depends on rainfall. Therefore, this study is very important because of limited availability of water and increase in the future water demand.Read: Supreme Court judge Justice S Ravinder Bhat's advise to Jamia studentsRead: Jamia's library first to acquire digitisation unit from France to minimise risk of coronavirus"

One can easily gauge its popularity from the fact that it has been at the numero uno position among the SUVs on the monthly sales charts on multiple occasions. But with the introduction of the second-generation Hyundai Creta, the launch of an updated Kia Seltos was more or less imminent. And so it happened. We saw the 2020 Kia Seltos being driven into the country earlier this month. While the Seltos was already loaded with features, many of them being first-in-segment and best-in-segment, Kia Motors India has now added some more bells and whistles to augment the SUV's overall appeal.The 2020 Kia Seltos now comes with the ESS (emergency stop signal) safety system as a standard feature across all the variants. The ESS plays a major role in avoiding rear-end collision by flashing lights frequently when sudden brake is applied at or over 55kmph, thereby enhancing manifold the safety quotient of the vehicle.There is no glaring exterior update in the 2020 Kia Seltos. But a new dual-tone colour combination has been added in the mix -- Punchy Orange with Clear White roof. The SUV now boasts of as many as five dual-tone paint schemes and all of them have an option for a sunroof. The customers can even opt for all-black interiors in top-of-the-line GTX+ trim. The incorporation of a FATC (fully automatic temperature control) with silver highlights definitely accords a more premium feel to the cabin.The major upgradation in the 2020 Kia Seltos is with regard to the UVO Connect. You might remember that the Seltos was introduced with as many as 37 connectivity features. Now, there are over 50 on offer. The SUV gets a new UVO-voice assist wake up command. You just need to say 'Hello Kia' and a plethora of data will be available on the touchscreen that houses the infotainment system. You can make calls, check live cricket scores, get information about weather and Indian holidays, and operate media, navigation and climate controls using voice command.The UVO-smartwatch app in the 2020 Kia Seltos enables a customer to connect his/her smartwatch with the SUV. Also available now is a new Bluetooth based application -- UVO LITE -- for controlling the smart air purifier and the infotainment system. All the automatic variants of the new Seltos can be started from a distance using the new smart-key remote engine start feature.There is no change in the engine and transmission options. Like earlier, the new Kia Seltos still has three powertrain choices -- Smartstream 1.4-litre T-GDI Petrol (140PS and 242Nm), Smartstream 1.5-litre Petrol (115PS and 144Nm) and 1.5-litre CRDi VGT Diesel (115 and 250Nm). The transmission variations include 6-speed MT and 7-speed DCT with Smartstream 1.4-litre T-GDI Petrol, 6-speed MT and IVT with Smartstream 1.5-litre Petrol, and 6-speed MT and 6-speed AT with 1.5-litre CRDi VGT Diesel.The 2020 Kia Seltos is available in seven variants, five for Tech Line (HTE, HTK, HTK Plus, HTX and HTX Plus) and two for GT Line (GTX and GTX Plus), with different engine and transmission combinations. Below are the 2020 Kia Seltos prices (ex-showroom, Delhi).Kia Seltos Smartstream 1.5-litre Petrol Prices-- HTE MT - 9.89 lakh-- HTK MT - 10.49 lakh-- HTK Plus MT - Rs 11.59 lakh-- HTX MT - Rs 13.34 lakh-- HTX IVT - Rs 14.34 lakhKia Seltos Smartstream 1.4-litre T-GDI Petrol Prices-- GTX MT - Rs 15.54 lakh-- GTX Plus MT - Rs 16.39 lakh-- GTX Plus DCT - Rs 17.29 lakhKia Seltos 1.5-litre CRDi VGT Diesel Prices-- HTE MT - Rs 10.34 lakh-- HTK MT - Rs 11.69 lakh-- HTK Plus MT - Rs 12.69 lakh-- HTK Plus AT - Rs 13.69 lakh-- HTX MT - Rs 14.44 lakh-- HTX Plus MT - Rs 15.49 lakh-- HTX Plus AT - Rs 16.49 lakh-- GTX Plus AT - Rs 17.34 lakhALSO READ | 2021 Geneva International Motor Show cancelled, event to be soldALSO READ | 2020 Honda City review: Ambitious new sedanALSO READ | Hero Xtreme 160R launched in India, price starts at Rs 99,950"

https://www.indiatoday.in/mail-today/story/decoding-the-app-ban-growth-plans-go-astray-for-chinese-firms-1695703-2020-07-01,2020-07-01 06:06:00,Decoding the app ban: Growth plans go astray for Chinese firms,"The comprehensive ban on TikTok and 58 other Chinese apps leaves the flourishing app economy in a state of disarray in the midst of a heightened sense of nationalism following the India-China standoff.The ban has wide-ranging implications for companies who own these apps; thousands of employees of these firms, besides an energetic breed of content creators and influencers who practically now suffer a 'career setback'.On a sticky wicketTherefore, let's begin with the legality of the ban and if the government has got all aspects covered. According to experts, in terms of legal and constitutional competencies, the government seems to be on a sticky wicket.First, the Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology (MeitY) order issued on Monday doesn't talk about specific evidence of violation in the order. It will have to be brought forward in case the ban is legally challenged, which is very likely.The order talks about ""misuse of some mobile apps on Android and iOS platforms for stealing and surreptitiously transmitting users' data in an unauthorised manner to servers which have locations outside India.""This issue is particularly tricky because India still doesn't have the Data Protection Act in place which specifically deals with such issues.The Privacy QuestionAlso, on the issue of privacy concerns raised in the MeitY order, there are no laws that specifically deal with it unless the government intends to refer to the 2017 order of the Supreme Court on the right to privacy.""There are no proper laws in areas like data protection and privacy. To implement cyber laws, there's no specific regulator. It's under everybody's jurisdiction, be it police, NITI Aayog, TRAI (Telecom Regulatory Authority of India), home ministry, and others,"" says Virag Gupta, a cyber lawyer.Chinese InvestmentsWhile the legality of the ban will take its time to unfold, what will be the immediate impact of the ban on the companies who own these apps, and Chinese investment in India?The ban on these apps will not only impact the popularity of these apps but also the valuation of their parent companies. For instance, TikTok which is one of the most popular apps in India with more than 200 million users, has witnessed 30.3% of its total downloads from this country.The parent companyByteDance was also planning to invest $1 billion in India and hire 1,000 people. Additionally there are talks about an IPO for ByteDance that is valued at more than $100 billion. But, in the larger scheme of things, the ban will have very little impact on Chinese investments in India. That is because a lot of Indian startups operate on funds from big Chinese investors.According to a report by thinktank Gateway House, as many as 18 of the 30 unicorns in India are backed by Chinese investors. Tech titans, the BAT companies - Baidu, Alibaba and Tencent - as they are called in China, are also a significant part of these investors.Paytm, Zomato, Byju's, Ola, Flipkart, Swiggy, OYO, Delhivery, Practo, Rivigo, MakeMyTrip, Big-Basket, Hike are some of the big home-grown companies to have Chinese investments. There are many others.The Big LosersBeyond the companies who own these apps, the worst hit due to the ban is the influencer community on TikTok. Influencers who were born on TikTok and didn't expand their presence across other social media platforms are likely to be hurt the most.However, those who had a presence across Instagram, YouTube amongst others, will be able to channelise their campaigns and continue to earn.Content creators will also face monetary losses since brands have already started putting their planned TikTok activities in pause mode for now.""The platform was used for influencer engagement. Given the massive fan following most influencers enjoyed, brands were engaging with them directly for promotion. I see those rates dropping down significantly now,"" says Nimesh Shah, Head Maven, Windchimes Communications.Industry experts believe that while there are no clear guidelines or clarity on the current situation, brands should quickly complete planned commitments with an additional post on linked channels such as Instagram.Once the platform is not accessible, all the scheduled campaigns from the brands will be on pause until further clarity from the government.READ | After ban, TikTok now stops working in India and shows internet errorALSO READ | All apps must adhere to India's data integrity, privacy: Niti Aayog CEOALSO WATCH | Strongly concerned, says China after India bans 59 Chinese apps"

The bills have been sent without taking the actual reading of the meters.According to a Greater Kailash resident Sandeep Anand, his electricity bill during last June was Rs 7,000, but this time he has been sent a bill of Rs 12,000. Hemant Sharma, a resident of Lajpat Nagar, said that his meter shows a reading of 1,835 units but the bill dictates it as 2,100 units.""While the highest ever peak load of Delhi is only 7409 MW, it's sad that Delhi DISCOMs are collecting the fixed charges on the total sanction of load of 22,876 MW. Shockingly, even during the lockdown period, while there was no economic activity, they still claimed the same from both the domestic & commercial consumers. DERC as well the government must look into it & must waive all the excessive charges to give a relief to the consumers,"" said B S Vohra, East Delhi RWA spokesperson.""Establishments were non functional and their consumption was bare minimum. Even after relaxation most establishments are not consuming as much power as their sanctioned load. Tenants have vacated or senior citizens who may have high sanctioned load but use lesser power due to children being out are all paying extra Rs 500 to Rs 1,250 as fixed charge. Billing should be on Maximum Demand Indicator and not on sanctioned load,"" said Rajiv Kakria, convener, Save Our City Campaign - a collective of RWAs, NGOs & activists.READ | Power discoms record rise of up to 90% in digital payments of electricity bills during lockdownALSO READ | Proposed electricity bill not in interest of poor, farmers: Chhattisgarh CM Bhupesh BaghelALSO WATCH | Salons reopen in Mumbai, step up safety measures amid coronavirus pandemic"

This India-built app, LightX Photo Editor, competes with now banned Chinese apps Meitu.""Chinese apps flooded the Indian market in 2014-2015 and it was tough to compete. So this decision by the government is a good decision, for our benefit,"" said Shankar.Prashant Kumar, co-founder, AndOr Communications added, ""We don't have Chinese investment in our company, everything is made in India. This will give an opportunity to Indians to capture their market. China had a strong hold over us. Now things will change.""Apps like Roposo are being aimed at Indians looking for a fun social media platform to interact. With Helo banned, Indian app Sharechat now has 100 million users.

Instead, he addressed an issue of far greater concern than Chinese military deployment in eastern Ladakh—the raging pandemic and its economic impact. His televised address to the nation--the sixth since he announced the nation-wide lockdown on March 24--focussed on food security for the poor. It was also underlined by the grim realisation that the pandemic and its aftereffects could continue throughout the year. This would necessitate continued government assistance to people below the poverty line (BPL).His relatively short 17-minute speech complemented the PM Garib Kalyan Rozgar Yojna--a rural employment scheme--for migrants by ensuring free grains for five more months, until November. The scheme, launched by the PM on June 20, aims to provide employment to migrant workers and create rural infrastructure. More importantly, it provides employment opportunities for the migrants who have returned to their villages. The government has set aside Rs 50,000 crore from its rural development budget for asset creation in 25 segments. Meanwhile, PMGKY entitles roughly 800 million beneficiaries 5 kgs of either rice or wheat free along with 1 kg of chana dal.The free rations scheme costs the government Rs 31,000 crore to help 200 million families; another Rs 18,000 crore goes to 90 million farmers as handouts.The beneficiaries of these schemes, he noted, were “more than two-and-a-half times the population of the US, 12 times that of the UK and double the population of the European Union”. The government would spend Rs 1.5 lakh crore overall on the free ration scheme for the poor till November. The announcement came a day after the home ministry rolled out guidelines for Lockdown 2.0 under which states may no longer have to seal borders but schools, colleges, gyms, bars, multiplexes and auditoriums will remain closed till July 31. It comes at a time when a rising tide of COVID-19 cases has caused hotspots like Maharashtra to re-impose a lockdown until July 31. The PM highlighted the worry that the coronavirus spread might gather speed in the coming days and that negligence in Unlock 1.0 was a cause of serious concern.When India entered Unlock 1.0 on June 1, it had over 190,000 reported positive cases and 5,400 deaths. In a month, this number has exploded to 567,000 positive cases with 16,893 people dead.ALSO READ | Can the big five turn the tide?Politically, opposition leaders like former Congress chief Rahul Gandhi, along with other party leaders, have questioned the Modi-led regime’s unlocking strategy, especially when all the big cities have failed to flatten the curve. It took an adverse remark from the Supreme Court for Union home minister Amit Shah to take charge of the COVID-19 preparations in national capital Delhi.PM Modi also sought to create a sense of pride by passing the credit for the PM Rozgar Yojana provisions to the farmers and honest taxpayers. Addressing the two sections, he said: “It is because of your honesty and hard work that the nation is able to fight poverty in such trying times. I bow to you.”The PM also said that people have to be more cautious in the monsoon season, when the change of weather often leads to cold and cough. He said that more care has to be taken with respect to wearing masks, social distancing and washing of hands for 20 seconds. The upward trajectory of the Covid infection is also forcing the migrant labourers to delay their return to the cities. The prime minister also spoke of a speedy launch for the One Nation One Ration Card plan.As economic activity gains steam, corporates and farmers have started complaining about the shortage of labour. The migrants, in turn, worry about infections along with whether they will be able to earn a living and get shelter if they come back. The Ram Vilas Paswan-led food and civil supplies ministry is working out a plan to formally roll out the One Nation One Ration Card plan.Last year, Paswan’s ministry did a pilot test of the scheme in four states--Gujarat, Maharashtra, Telangana and Andhra Pradesh. The plan now is to roll out the scheme in Haryana, Rajasthan, Karnataka, Kerala, Madhya Pradesh, Goa, Jharkhand, Tripura, Bihar, Uttar Pradesh, Punjab, Himachal Pradesh and Daman and Diu. The PMO wants the scheme to cover all the states by March 1, 2021.During Modi 1.0, Paswan’s ministry completed the linking of the Aadhar card with ration cards. The new system will allow the beneficiary to get (subsidised) rations at fair price shops anywhere in the country. The entries in these cards will now happen bilingually; in a vernacular language along with Hindi or English. The ration cards will have a 10 digit unique number; with the first two digits identifying the state of origin.Subscribe to the daily newsletter for sharp insights delivered straight to your inbox https://www.indiatoday.in/newsletter"

In the picture, the man is seen pointing the gun at the Indian flag.Several Facebook users have posted the image with a caption in Hindi that translates to, ""This man is a resident of Santoshpuri in Kolkata's Maheshtala area. Make this so viral that he is arrested."" India Today Anti Fake News War Room (AFWA) has found the claim along with the picture to be misleading. The two-year-old image is from Siwan in Bihar and the man, Sajid Hussain, was arrested for insulting the Tricolour after he had posted the picture on social media.The archived versions of the posts can be seen here and here. The picture along with the misleading claim has been posted by several Facebook users.AFWA probeWith the help of reverse image search, we found news reports related to the image.A local news website called ""Siwan Online"" had reported on August 30, 2018, that a man who had posted his picture standing on the national flag was arrested from Siwan.This incident was also reported by Hindi news website ""Prabhat Khabar"" on the same day.As per these news reports, one Sajid Hussain, son of Tayyab Hussain, from Bihar's Siwan was arrested for insulting the Tricolour and posting the image on social media. ""Prabhat Khabar"" spoke to the local police and confirmed the news.

India Today Anti Fake News War Room (AFWA) has found the claim to be misleading. The choppers seen in the viral video are not of IAF and they are not patrolling over Pangong Tso. These are United States marine choppers flying over Lake Havasu in Arizona.The archived versions of the posts can be seen here, here and here. Multiple Facebook users have posted the clip with a similar claim. These posts can be seen here.AFWA investigationWith the help of InVID, reverse image search and keyword search, we found that several American pilots and military veterans have posted the same video on Instagram recently, claiming this to be from Lake Havasu in Arizona, where fighter pilots often perform low-flying maneuvers.View this post on InstagramIt’s a race to Taco ??

We found several videos of Lake Havasu on YouTube where similar air maneuvers were being performed by military choppers. A very similar video of a low-flying Apache helicopter over Lake Havasu from 2018 is also found on YouTube.We found there is a stark difference of colours between a US marine chopper and an IAF helicopter. An IAF chopper always has the Tricolour on its tail. The chopper in the viral video bears no Tricolour.US marine chopper IAF helicopter Lake Havasu is a canyon, its blue-green water surrounded by stiff hills in most places. Comparing a Google Earth image of the lake with the viral video we found similar structures and geographical identities.Google Earth image of Lake Havasu Still frame from viral video On condition of anonymity, an IAF source also confirmed to us that the viral video is not of IAF's Apache helicopters over Pangong Tso.We could not ascertain the exact date the viral video was shot, but it is certain that the video is not of IAF choppers patrolling over Pangong Tso, but US marine helicopters over Lake Havasu, Arizona.window._ttCc = window._ttCc || [];_ttCc.push(function(){callJavaScriptFile(""//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js"");}); INDIA TODAY FACT CHECK      ClaimVideo of Indian Air Force's Apache helicopters patrolling over Pangong Tso in Ladakh.ConclusionThese are United States marine choppers flying over Lake Havasu in Arizona.JHOOTH BOLE KAUVA KAATEThe number of crows determines the intensity of the lie.1 Crow: Half True2 Crows: Mostly lies3 Crows: Absolutely false Want to send us something for verification?
