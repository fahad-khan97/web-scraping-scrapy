There was no official word on the outcome of the third round of talks on Tuesday between 14 Corps commander Lt-General Harinder Singh and South Xinjiang Military District chief Major General Liu Lin, who had held similar marathon dialogues on June 6 and June 22. The meeting on Tuesday, being held on the Indian side of the Chushul-Moldo border personnel meeting (BPM) point in eastern Ladakh for the first time, began at 11 am and continued till late in the night. But sources said China, instead of de-inducting troops, has continued with its military build-up in different sectors along the 3,488-km LAC, with an increase in activity by the People’s Liberation Army (PLA) also being witnessed across Sikkim and Arunachal Pradesh as well. India, while pressing for restoration of status quo as it existed in mid-April, has been matching the PLA deployments with additional troops, artillery guns, tanks and other armoured vehicles. As per the plan agreed upon during the corps commanders meeting on June 22, the rival troops were first to be physically separated by a distance of at least 2.5 to 3 km in all the confrontation or “friction” sites at the Galwan Valley region, Gogra-Hotsprings, Pangong Tso and Depsang to cool down the heightened tensions. In the meeting on Tuesday, India in particular asked the PLA to pull back from the “Finger-4 to 8” stretch (mountainous spurs separated over a distance of 8-km) on the north bank of Pangong Tso, “Patrolling Point-14 (PP-14)” in Galwan Valley and the “Bottleneck” area in Depsang Plains of eastern Ladakh.  “This will ensure another bloody skirmish like the one near PP-14 in Galwan on June 15 (in which 20 Indian soldiers and an unspecified number of PLA troops were killed) does not happen again. But it is yet to take place on the ground,” said a source. After a brief pull-back initially in the Galwan Valley, the PLA had reneged on the agreement to come back to the confrontation site, leading to the escalation in tensions between the rival troops. “There has been no real disengagement on the ground, with the PLA just moving about a dozen vehicles up and down. The Chinese, in fact, have fortified their positions further. Full disengagement, if it happens, might take a few months. We are prepared for the long haul,” he added. ",Rajat Pandit
https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/indias-app-ban-threatens-chinas-rise-as-a-global-tech-power/articleshow/76715699.cms,2020-06-30 21:49:00,India’s app ban threatens China’s rise as a global tech power,"China over the past decade built an alternate online reality where Google and Facebook barely exist. Now its own largest tech corporations from Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. to Tencent Holdings Ltd. are getting a taste of what a shutout feels like. India’s unprecedented decision to ban 59 of China’s largest apps is a warning to the country’s tech giants, who for years thrived behind a government-imposed Great Firewall that kept out many of America’s best-known internet names. If India finds a way to carry out that threat, it may present a model for other countries from Europe to Southeast Asia that seek to curtail the pervasiveness of apps like ByteDance Ltd.’s TikTok while safeguarding their citizens’ enormously valuable data. The surprise moratorium hit Chinese internet companies just as they were beginning to make headway in the world’s fastest-growing mobile arena, en route to going global and challenging American tech industry supremacy. TikTok had signed up 200 million users there, Xiaomi Corp. is the No. 1 smartphone brand, and Alibaba and Tencent have aggressively pushed their services. But India’s policy jeopardizes all those successes, and could have wider geopolitical consequences as the US seeks to rally countries to stop using Huawei Technologies Co. for 5G networks. With China’s tech companies poised to become some of the most dominant in emerging industries like artificial intelligence, India’s actions may spur countries around the world to weigh the extent to which they let China gain user data -- and potentially economic leverage in future disputes. “Techno-nationalism will manifest itself increasingly across all aspects of geopolitics: national security, economic competitiveness, even social values,” said Alex Capri, a Singapore-based research fellow at the Hinrich Foundation. “It will be increasingly difficult to separate Chinese tech firms from the CCP and China’s geopolitical ambitions. They will find themselves increasingly locked out.” Chinese internet firms have struggled to replicate their online services beyond their home turf, even before Washington lawmakers began raising concerns about the wisdom of allowing the Asian country’s corporations -- like ByteDance -- to hoover up valuable personal data. India amplified those concerns by accusing apps including TikTok, Tencent’s WeChat, Alibaba’s UC Web and Baidu Inc.’s map and translation services of threatening its sovereignty and security. India’s prohibition provides further evidence that nations are using tech for to assert themselves geopolitically, following the Trump administration’s worldwide campaign to contain China and national champions like Huawei. That depends in part on how much Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s actions are motivated by domestic interests following the worst military clash between India and China in almost half a century. “Beijing should certainly worry that the impact of the deadly clash could push India toward the US,” said Zhang Baohui, director of the Centre for Asian Pacific Studies at Lingnan University. “But these recent economic measures by India may not by themselves concern Beijing too much as it understands that Modi’s government, facing rising domestic nationalism, has to do something to soothe the public sentiments and retain legitimacy.” It remains unclear how India will enforce its decision, given TikTok -- for one -- has already been downloaded by roughly one in six people. But it follows a series of steps to curb China’s presence in the country, demonstrating the administration’s hardened resolve since long-simmering tensions boiled over after a deadly Himalayan border clash that killed 20 Indian soldiers. The country’s government procurement website has barred purchases of Chinese-made goods. Authorities have asked the largest e-commerce companies, including Amazon.com Inc. and Walmart Inc.’s Flipkart, to start showing “country of origin” on goods sold. And India is said to be dragging its heels on clearing goods imported from China, stranding electronics at ports. “The Indian government thinks about governing the internet in a very similar way to China, which is blanket bans, asserting national boundaries on the internet and essentially carving out what would eventually become a version of the Indian Great Firewall,” said Dev Lewis, a research fellow at Digital Asia Hub in Shanghai. “Everyone’s struggling to deal with governing technology companies and apps, especially ones that cross borders. So when India takes a step like this, it sets a precedent for the things that you can do.” In terms of the immediate business consequences, ByteDance could be hardest-hit. India is its biggest market with more than 200 million TikTok users. During a brief ban last year, the Chinese company estimated it was missing out on half a million dollars a day of revenue. In a statement posted to Twitter, TikTok India head Nikhil Gandhi said the company complies with all data privacy and security requirements under Indian law and has not shared any user information with any foreign government, including Beijing. India’s prohibition could also give American companies a possible edge over Chinese players in a rare global tech market that is both populous and not yet saturated. While WeChat never made it big in India, banning it may help shore up Facebook Inc.’s WhatsApp. Cutting out TikTok immediately gives Alphabet Inc.’s YouTube a boost. On Tuesday, Ministry of Foreign Affairs spokesman Zhao Lijian said China was “strongly concerned” about India’s actions. “The Indian government has a responsibility to uphold the legitimate and legal rights of the international investors including Chinese ones,” he said. But for now, China doesn’t have many great options to retaliate. “While Beijing is highly adept at economic coercion, in this case it has somewhat limited options to act in a reciprocal manner,” analysts for the Eurasia Group wrote in a research note. “Bilateral trade is heavily weighted toward Chinese exports to India. Attempts to hurt India economically could blowback on Chinese companies.” ",

In a notification, the Home Ministry said the central government is of the opinion that the area comprising the whole Nagaland is in such a disturbed and dangerous condition that the use of armed forces in aid of the civil power is necessary. ""Now, therefore, in exercise of the powers conferred by Section 3 of the Armed Forces (Special Powers) Act, 1958 (No. 28 of 1958) the central government hereby declares that whole of the said State to be a 'disturbed area' for a period of six months with effect from 30th June, 2020 for the purpose of that Act,"" the home ministry said.

The decision to maintain the status quo in Nagaland regarding coverage of AFSPA, a law slammed by many civil society groups as ""draconian"", came amidst reports of deteriorating law and order situation there. The AFSPA gives the armed forces sweeping powers to search and arrest, and to open fire if they deem it necessary for ""the maintenance of public order"". ",

Indian students need not go to western countries to do a programme in Liberal Arts. They now have one avenue to do a Liberal Arts programme in India without compromising on the quality and flexibility offered by the universities abroad. Bennett University is launching Liberal Arts program from the academic year 2020.


The programme, which is of three years duration, allows students to pace their learning, and gives them space to decide the courses of their choice. It also offers them the opportunity to do an extra one year and earn a Post-Graduate Diploma in their chosen area of study after finishing their degree.


The programme has been designed to provide all round, holistic development to students; education that develops skills, improves perspectives and prepares students to deal with everyday challenges of life in a balanced and responsible manner. 

An important feature of the programme is that the students do not have to choose their Major at the time of admission. Instead, they have one full year to explore their area of interest. It is only in the second year that they decide their Major.


Here too they have a wide choice. They have ten domains to choose a Major from. These include: 
Psychology, Philosophy, Business Studies, Marketing, Journalism, Advertising & Public Relations, Economics, Political Science, English Literature and Finance.

Further, each Major has a specialized basket of Electives, courses which have been hand-picked to help students further their knowledge and allow them to explore new areas of interest. 


The students are also exposed to a wide range of Foundation courses in the first year to broaden their knowledge and build all-round skills such as oral and writing skills, critical thinking skills and problem-solving skills. 


The Bennett University Programme is not limited to classroom learning alone. The students will earn credits for playing physical sports or going to the gym. They will be given classics and bestsellers from various fields to read, analyse and discuss. This will help improve their conversational skills and perspectives and challenge dogmas. They will also get an opportunity to meet and interact with some of the leading lights of the media and the industry.


Such all-round learning will improve the worldview, self-esteem and confidence of students, and open a wide range of career options. These include journalism, public relations, content creation, advertising, marketing, finance, management, counselling, analytics, consultancy, economic services, civil services, and many more.


The Finance, Business Studies and Marketing Majors will also impart leadership skills and help students climb the corporate ladder faster. 
These three Majors are not offered by other Liberal Arts programs in the country and are quite unique to Bennett University’s Liberal Arts programme.  

 Educationists believe that Liberal Arts programmes will change the course of higher education in India. They will lead to the emergence of a new generation of youngsters who are more confident, more skilled and better able to deal with the challenges of life.

While the paparazzi couldn’t capture her happy smile because of the funky face mask, Sara Ali Khan made it a point to greet them with her signature ‘namaste’. 

 

 

 

 

Sara Ali Khan has signed up to play the leading lady in Aanand L Rai directed ‘Atrangi Re’, which will feature Akshay Kumar and Dhanush as leads. Sara Ali Khan will be essaying a double role in the film. A source had earlier told Mumbai Mirror, “While ‘Atrangi Re’ is primarily a love story set in the heartland, laced with humour, the storytelling is in a zone the filmmaker has not attempted before. The screenplay follows a non-linear narrative of two romances from different timelines running in the parallel. It’s a double role of sorts for Sara, the idea is to showcase the diverse sides of the actress. Akshay and Dhanush’s characters too have a special trait that separates them from rest of the cast. Their appearances will be in sync with the way they act and react while a special look is being designed for Akshay.”

 Due to the lockdown the shoot of ‘Atrangi Re’ was postponed. Sara and Dhanush were to reportedly start shooting for ‘Atrangi Re’ in Bihar and Madurai, while Akshay was to join them later in mid-April.

The US telecommunications regulator voted on November 5 to issue the declaration and proposed requiring rural carriers to remove and replace equipment from the two Chinese companies from existing US networks. ""We cannot and will not allow the Chinese Communist Party to exploit network vulnerabilities and compromise our critical communications infrastructure,"" FCC chairman Ajit Pai said in a statement Tuesday. Huawei and ZTE did not immediately respond to requests for comment but have previously sharply criticized the FCC's actions. FCC Commissioner Geoffrey Starks said on Tuesday that ""untrustworthy equipment"" remains in place in US networks and said the US Congress must allocate funding for replacements. In May 2019, Trump signed an executive order declaring a national emergency and barring US companies from using telecommunications equipment made by companies posing a national security risk. The Trump administration also added Huawei to its trade blacklist last year. The FCC has taken an increasingly hard line against Chinese firms. In April, the FCC said it may shut down US operations of three state-controlled Chinese telecommunications companies The FCC required China Telecom Americas, China Unicom Americas, Pacific Networks Corp and its wholly owned subsidiary ComNet (USA) LLC to explain why it should not start the process of revoking authorisations enabling their US operations. The FCC granted its approvals to the firms more than a decade ago. In May 2019, the FCC voted to deny another state-owned Chinese telecommunications company, China Mobile Ltd, the right to provide US services, citing risks that the Chinese government could use the company to conduct espionage against the US government.

Beijing must also allow the United Nations rights chief meaningful access to its western Xinjiang province, said the states -- including Britain, France, Germany and Japan -- in a rare oral rebuke of China at the UN Human Rights Council in Geneva. Julian Braithwaite, Britain's ambassador to the UN in Geneva, read the statement at the council, on behalf of all the signatories. The 27 countries have ""deep and growing concerns"" over the new security law, which has clear implications on the human rights of people in Hong Kong, the statement said. Imposing the law without the direct participation of Hong Kong's people, legislature or judiciary ""undermines"" the 'One Country, Two Systems' principle guaranteeing Hong Kong a high degree of autonomy, rights and freedoms, the signatories said. ""We urge the Chinese and Hong Kong governments to reconsider the imposition of this legislation and to engage Hong Kong's people, institutions and judiciary to prevent further erosion of the rights and freedoms that the people of Hong Kong have enjoyed for many years,"" the statement said. Signatories included Australia, Canada, New Zealand, Switzerland and 15 European Union states including the Netherlands and Sweden. ""A number of the signatories to this statement submitted a letter last year to express concern about arbitrary detention, widespread surveillance and restrictions, particularly targeting Uighurs and other minorities in Xinjiang,"" the statement pointed out. ""These deep concerns have been reinforced by additional information now in the public domain."" A study by a German researcher said Monday that Chinese authorities were carrying out forced sterilisations of Uighur and other ethnic minority women in an apparent campaign to curb the population. The countries urged China to allow Michelle Bachelet, the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights, ""meaningful access to Xinjiang at the earliest opportunity"". The signatories urged Bachelet to provide regular information on the human rights situation in Xinjiang and Hong Kong, ""in order to safeguard the rights and freedoms which are guaranteed under international law"".

Congress spokesperson Supriya Shrinate said Modi did not look the ""enemy"" in the eye, which was expected of him after a bloody standoff with China in Ladakh on June 15. ""Our biggest expectation was that the PM will gather the courage and the will to look at China in the eye and reply to the enemy. Take the enemy head-on and make a very strong statement against what China is doing. But the PM once again shied away,"" she said. The Congress has been demanding the Prime Minister to name China as ""aggressor"" and send a strong message to it after 20 Indian soldiers were killed in violent clash with Chinese troops. On Monday, the government banned 59 mobile applications with Chinese links, including TikTok and UC Browser, saying they were prejudicial to sovereignty, integrity and security of the country. During his 16-minute televised address on Tuesday, Modi cautioned people against laxity in following government guidelines and taking precautions against the coronavirus. He said India was comparatively better positioned vis-a-vis many other countries because of ""timely imposition"" of a nationwide lockdown and other decisions of his government. He also announced extension of a central government scheme to provide free ration to over 80 crore people, hit by the pandemic, until November. Shrinate said many had hoped the Prime Minister would talk about substantive steps to contain the pandemic and putting the economy back on track, but he did not. She said the Prime Minister only talked about the extension of an existing scheme, which could have been done by issuing a simple notification. ""Neither did the Prime Minister talk about job losses and wage cuts,"" she said, ""nor did he announce the much needed relief to migrant labourers and the poor."" Urging Modi to ensure a cash transfer of Rs 7,500 to the poor, the Congress spokesperson said he should keep ""raj dharma"" and national interest in mind in doing so. The Prime Minister said everything was well but the truth is ""far from that"" as India is among the top four nations as far as Covid-19 cases are concerned. India's Covid-19 tally climbed to 5,66,840 on Tuesday with nearly 66 per cent cases reported in June alone. For seven days, the country has been reporting more than 15,000 cases and experts say the pandemic has yet to reach its peak. ""There was massive euphoria and build up. At the end of it, the Prime Minister's address was 'much ado about nothing. We had great expectations from the Prime Minister. once again he belied our expectations,"" she said at a virtual press conference. The congress leader said it seems the top priority of the PM is the Bihar elections. ""The hype and build up was all aimed at headline management,"" she said. ",

https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/spotlight/why-adopt-a-sugar-free-lifestyle-in-these-covid-times/articleshow/76705630.cms,2020-06-30 17:51:00,Why adopt a sugar-free lifestyle in these COVID times?,"We all know the famous saying, “Tough times don’t last, tough people, do!” Due to the restrictions imposed in the COVID-19 pandemic, we have already altered our physical activity by more than half. 
We are burning far fewer calories as compared to how much we would burn earlier on a typical workday. This is even more alarming because our 
daily intake of food has increased whilst sitting at home, be it binge-eating while watching TV shows, emotional-eating due to anxiety or excessive overwhelm. The current situation, which is here to stay for a while, combined with restrictions on daily movement and excess-eating, might have some 
severe consequences for our health & body weight. However, people can still get started on their journey towards being fit. 

 


Two of the prime reasons behind weight gain are – 
fatty and sugary foods.
While most people are taking a conscious effort to reduce oily food in their diet, sugar is an element that we are overlooking and neglecting. Even our coffee/tea doses for the day are filled with sugar. 
Just two cups of coffee/tea can account for around 80 calories from sugar, which is approximately equivalent to the calories burnt in a 2 km walk! And now that most people have resorted to baking while at home, sugar is an element that has been overused intensely. This is why 
practicing sugar-distancing, along with social-distancing, is of prime importance and should become a priority. 

 

Here is where the role of 
low-calorie sweeteners like Sugar Free comes into play. Low-calorie sweetener is a food additive that provides a 
sweet taste like that of sugar while containing significantly less food energy than sugar-based sweeteners, making it a 
zero-calorie or low-calorie sweetener (LCS). LCS when used to replace sugar in the products consumed in the diet, may be 
beneficial for weight management.1 Low-calorie sweeteners can be used for beverages and baking as they come in pellets, sachets, and powder form. 

 

Conversations often arise around the safety of switching to low-calorie sweeteners and their health benefits. However, 
low calorie sweeteners available in the market are thoroughly investigated and their safety is confirmed by many studies. The key ingredients of these sugar substitutes like aspartame, sucralose and stevia have been 
recognized safe by US FDA2 & by 
JECFA3,4, an international scientific expert committee administered jointly by the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO) and WHO. In India, Low-calorie sweeteners are regulated by 
FSSAI and are 
safe* for consumption.

 

Renowned 
Chef Sanjeev Kapoor also suggested tips to maintain one’s fitness during these trying times. He says, “Just make sure you're eating right, providing your body with 
appropriate nutrition and keeping it 
hydrated. In this situation, for instance, since I have a sweet tooth, I make sure to 
substitute the regular sugar with Sugar Free products whenever possible. Also, try and consume a lot of salads, fresh fruits, and vegetables if you can procure them. They are a rich source of fibre along with vitamins like vitamin C, folic acid, beta carotene (precursor of Vitamin A) etc. that are vital for good health. ”

Leading 
nutritionist Ishi Khosla also provided her inputs to keep one’s diet in check, “Since our bodies are at rest, it’s important to remember that our diets can’t be the same as before. We need to 
cut down on the number of meals and maybe limit them to just two. When our movements get curtailed, our appetite falls, but cravings increase. We shouldn’t give in to those cravings. It’s important to 
restrict one’s diet without compromising on nutrition. Include immunity-boosting food like aloe vera, tulsi, coconut oil in the diet. 
Replace sugar with low-calorie sweeteners and keep hydrating! New realities mean that we need to look at food and diet in a new way.”
Lastly, it is imperative to remain positive during this pandemic. Eating on time can affect your alertness and productivity. Try and ensure that this lockdown is beneficial to you and helps you realize, reassess, and reorganize your routine to emerge stronger, fitter, and healthier. Don’t forget to keep sanitizing!

World Bank research states that the productivity of 56 per cent children is halved because of the lack of a wholesome education. In today’s rapidly evolving global environment, an effective schooling experience prepares children to face these challenges and primes them for success.

The International Baccalaureate (IB) is a rigorous curriculum that helps students into curious and responsible world citizens. At its crux, the IB is about equipping students with the tools they need to thrive in a futuristic professional environment, while simultaneously inspiring them to make a difference beyond the classroom through community action.

 


Some of the salient features of this program that help children take the next steps after school are:

1. Academic breadth and depth
The IB Diploma Programme is considered a Gold Standard for admission to the world’s best universities. This programme prepares the students for higher education by enabling them to develop skills like problem solving, critical thinking, research and time management.

 



2. International Mindedness
The IB education helps students to reflect on their own identity as well as their role in the world at large. Across all programmes, facilitators actively seek out opportunities to integrate a global perspective into everyday classroom experiences. This helps children to build a global mindset by fostering creativity, knowledge and skills that will allow them to work collaboratively with people from diverse backgrounds, cultures and perspectives across the globe; respect diversity but at the same time uphold what brings people together - Humanity.

3. Learning How to Learn
This program is based on a constructivist approach. Students are at the centre of all activities and they construct their own knowledge through inquiry and reflection. Facilitators do not provide direct answers rather encourage them to discover their own.

 


The inquiry based pedagogy goes beyond content and inspires all round development through development of ATL skills like thinking, communication, social, self management and research skills. The focus is on the holistic development of students.

The International Baccalaureate Curriculum at Apeejay School International, South Delhi is powered by the Apeejay Stya Legacy of over five decades of educational excellence and is designed to provide global education of the highest standard that is centred around the human values. This school is slated to be Delhi’s first and only IB Continuum (Primary Years Programme, Middle Years Programme, Diploma Programme) day boarding school with state-of-the-art infrastructure and sports facilities. It is already an authorised IB World School for the Diploma Programme.
Located in South Delhi, it offers a safe and secure campus to its students. It is fully equipped with CCTVs, Visitor Management and Access Control Systems.

Apeejay School International has taken many strides forward and its emphasis is onintegrating technologies like Artificial Intelligence, Internet of Things (IoT), and Virtual Reality into everyday life at school. Its focus is on integrated education. It is driven in its endeavor of enabling students to go beyond mechanical learning. The school concentrates on collaborative experiential learning. Highly trained and experienced faculty at Apeejay School International ensures that students can make the most of a superlative schooling experience.

The school has also received accolades for its work in shaping children and helping them reach their potential in this dynamic environment. It was recognized by the Knowledge Review Magazine as one of India’s Best International Schools for 2018. At DNA’s 11th Innovative Education Leadership Awards, it won the title of the ‘Most Innovative IB School.’ It has also won the ELETS School Education Award for Excellence in International Curriculum Practices.

 


The choice of school indeed plays a significant role to ensure a successful future for children. Foundation years are most crucial for children to grow into individuals who can find their footing in varied, dynamic environments.

Bhat, 35, recently recalled how she grabbed a backpack and hustled her US-born 4-year-old son to the San Francisco airport to catch a midnight flight to India, her home country. She didn’t anticipate being stuck there indefinitely. Bhat works at a tech company in Silicon Valley on an H-1B visa, and her documents were due for renewal. So she threw them in the bag, knowing she’d have to get the chore taken care of before flying back to the US in a few weeks. But she said her mid-March appointment at the US consulate in Kolkata was canceled when it shut down due to Covid-19 concerns. Her return home was delayed further when President Donald Trump signed an executive order last week barring many people on several types of visas, including H-1Bs, from entering the country until 2021. Trump’s executive order is the latest step in his years-long tightening of US immigration policy. The president has argued since taking office the visa programs allow employers to undercut native-born workers on wages, over the objections of companies that say they need highly skilled workers to fill crucial job openings. The latest restrictions, said Greg Siskind, an immigration lawyer in Memphis, “use the pandemic as an excuse to achieve anti-immigration goals the administration has wanted to do for years.” H-1B holders, about three-quarters of whom work in the tech sector, have felt a creeping sense of unease since Trump took office. Still, thousands of them continued to fly back and forth between the US and their home countries, for weddings or funerals—or for work assignments or to get mundane paperwork taken care of. (Some visas require people to leave the country briefly after approval to get their passports stamped.) Many of those who left the US this spring, as Bhat did, found the world as they knew it changed mid-trip. About 375,000 temporary visaholders and green card applicants will now be banned from entering the US until next year, according to Julia Gelatt, a senior policy analyst with the Migration Policy Institute, a non-partisan research group. A significant number of those are now stuck in India, which has long had a close connection to Silicon Valley. The technology industry has consistently objected to the administration’s immigration restrictions, and Amazon.com Inc, Alphabet Inc and Twitter Inc immediately condemned the latest executive order, along with trade groups representing hundreds of other technology firms. The objections haven’t spared people like Bhat and her husband, who have worked in Silicon Valley for the last nine years, she as a manager for a software firm and he as an engineer at a bank. Her husband flew back to the US in early March for work and has spent the past four months of lockdown alone. Bhat is now working overnight to support her US-based clients, and trying to convince their son Adhrit to eat Indian food like chapati for breakfast over his complaints that he misses his standard Californian breakfast of avocado toast. The prospect of a wave of people stranded abroad began worrying Siskind several weeks ago when he first caught wind of the planned order. On Twitter, he warned workers on non-immigrant visas not to leave the US. He urged those abroad to come back as soon as possible. Once the order took effect, Siskind set up an online form for people to share their stories, and asked his followers on social media to fill it out. Within 24 hours, he had over 500 responses. There was the scientist researching coronavirus-testing products who flew to India to get married, the Atlanta-based IT consultant who may miss the birth of his child, the 2-year-old girl who was born in the US and has developed severe allergic skin reactions to mosquito bites in India, the Intel Corp employee who is now running critical projects from afar. Siskind fielded calls from husbands separated from wives, parents from children. People told him they were worried about keeping up with mortgage payments on houses, car loans and jobs. Some had US-born children who are American citizens enrolled in US schools. Many have valid visas and assumed all they would need to get back in the country was a routine stamp in their passport. Narendra Singh, an Indian-born software architect who has lived in Dallas for nine years, took his family back to Kolkata in February. Their return was delayed when the consulates closed and they were advised to wait out the worst of the pandemic. Now Singh is working remotely. His wife, a software engineer, lost her job in April. Their daughter, a US citizen, was slated to start preschool in the fall, but they’ve been preparing her for the possibility that won’t happen. Singh, 36, said he knew there was always a chance of his visa not being extended, but assumed he was secure until his current visa was set to expire in 2022. “We took specialized jobs, we followed the rules, we got the visas,” he said. “I just feel betrayed.” Mili Widhani Khatter, 39, who has lived in the US with her husband and two US-born children for the past 12 years, flew back to Delhi, India, without her family to say goodbye to her dying mother. She hasn’t seen her children in nearly four months, and said her 2-year-old son has forgotten how to say “mama” since they’ve been apart. “This is the worst punishment you can give to a mom,” Khatter said. “It’s not humane.” Now families worry what another six months of uncertainty will do to their kids—and to the futures they thought they were charting. “I have a valid visa. I’ve been living in the Bay Area for eight years. I have a life there and a home there, and my husband is there,” Bhat said. “Will I ever be able to go back?” ",

The Qayamat Ki Raat actor, who was not willing to talk to the media until now and was sharing posts on his social media account claiming Shweta and he are still together, has finally opened up on the entire issue.

In an exclusive interview with ETimes TV, Abhinav alleged that Shweta is not letting him meet their son Reyaansh and he has been feeling helpless about the same. He also shared that the estranged couple was very much in touch with each other even post their much talked about police complaint last year.

Abhinav spoke about taking care of their son Reyaansh and being available for Shweta whenever she needed him.

""I am only talking now because I feel cheated. From September last year to May 2020, Shweta has been in touch with me and I have taking care of her and my baby's requirements. Car mein petrol bharane se lekar, Reyaansh ke liye kuch kharidna hai, I was always there. Whenever she needed me be it 2 am or 4 am I was there because I wanted to stay with my baby, but now she is not letting me meet him. She has treated me like a servant. I just want someone from Human Rights or any NGO to come forward and help me reunite with my baby. It has been more than a month and 15 days that I have not met or seen him, please someone help me. All this while I kept quite thinking that her behaviour is good to me, so it is better for our child because he is getting the love of both his parents. On May 14, while I was talking to Reyaansh, he said, ""Mujhe papa ki yaad nahi aati'. I was shocked that a 4 year-old boy doesn't even know the meaning of the word 'yaad'. I told Shweta you haven't even filed for divorce and you are teaching him such stuff so that you can take him away from me. He used to be with me from morning to night, that kid will never say such a thing. I've tried my best to make this relationship work,"" he said.

Abhinav further alleged that when he went to meet his son Reyaansh on May 14, Shweta called up the cops and dragged him outside the compound, ""I met my son Reyaansh last time on May 15. Shweta let me meet him and at that time she wasn't scared about the coronavirus. But suddenly she is not letting me meet him (Reyaansh) and is making an excuse that due to COVID-19 she wants to keep Reyaansh away from me. On May 15, you allow me to meet the child and suddenly you are talking about coronavirus. For two months I myself didn't try to meet our son for his safety since I was stepping out frequently to buy groceries or other stuff. On May 14th, Shweta made a video call as Reyaansh was crying and wanted to speak to me. Suddenly, when Shweta left the room and shut the door, he yelled very loudly and threw away the iPad, I got scared for him and immediately rushed to meet him. Shweta called the cops and dragged me out of the house. I mean what was my fault, I got worried for my child. During these two months, I stayed in contact with Reyaansh over phone calls and video calls. And when I went to meet him on May 14th, she called the police. I was pleading with the cops to let me meet my baby. I cried for three hours that day at the police station as I just wanted to meet my baby and was feeling helpless. The cops were telling me 'Arre Kohli sahab aap chup hojaao aap mard hokar kyun ro rahe ho' (policemen asked me to stop crying). I told them I just want to meet my child, what crime have I done that you have dragged me here. On May 15th, I again went to her house because I don't want my son to grow up thinking that his father didn't even try and his mother is so strong and influential that she dragged me out of the house by calling the cops. I played with him. But after that whenever I have tried to meet Reyaansh, she has started making excuses that baby is sleeping. They just shut the door on me. I would shout at the door pyaaru pyaaru but nobody opened the door,"" the actor said.
 
When asked if they were together why did Shweta call their relationship a 'wound' during press interactions of Mere Dad Ki Dulhan last year, ""She has been in touch with me, I think 15 days after the complaint was filed against me in August last year. From morning to night, I have taken care of Reyaansh as she would go for her shoot. She would be in touch with me through phone and texts. The baby would be with me from 11 am in the morning till late night as she came late at night or would go for a party after shoot. Throughout Mere Dad Ki Dulhan and even during the shoot of her web series, I have taken care of the baby. There is a separate room made for Reyaansh on the set, but he hardly stays there. Everyone on the sets knows that I would come on the sets and be with our son or sometimes even bring him home. There was a time when Reyaansh was unwell but he wanted to be with his mother, so I was on the set the entire day. During the shooting of her web series, I was staying with her in the same room and taking care of the kid. From taking care of his medicines, buying them because she had asked me to in the middle of the night to being with him while she was shooting, I've taken care of our son. So, now how can she stop me from meeting him. I've done everything but this is what I get in return.""

He further continued, ""My father died in 2015 and I had to go and take care of my mother in Bangalore and the business of the publishing house that they run there. From that time she started fighting, she did not even give me time to mourn, I was busy taking care of her. After my father died, the next day, I had to take her to a physio because of her backache. I forgot my pain. She has been asking for divorce since 2016 but I always told her no and asked her to resolve our problems mutually. I told her marriage is not a joke, if you wanted divorce then we should have never planned a baby. We should not torture the little baby and let us give him normal parenting. Let both the parents be with him during his growing up years.""

Abhinav also stated that he took a back seat in his career even during his second innings as Shweta decided to work again, ""We had a very cordial relationship like a proper husband and wife. She stopped me from meeting my kid saying that she fears COVID-19, but she is herself meeting her co-star from Mere Dad Ki Dulhan. She can have all the fun, but I can't meet my baby. Even during my second innings when I started doing shows like Qayamat Ki Raat, Ishq Mein Marjawan and Daayan after sometime she took up work and I took a backseat in my career. I rejected few shows which were offered to me at that time because I felt at least one parent should be with the kid. She didn't let me speak to my son even on Father's Day and my birthday. She is not letting me, meet my baby if I am going there to meet, she calls the cops. I am feeling helpless,"" concluded Abhinav.

ETimes TV tried contacting Shweta Tiwari but she did not revert to our message.

https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/spotlight/why-people-are-switching-network-providers-during-the-lockdown/articleshow/76685120.cms,2020-06-30 11:31:00,Why people are switching network providers during the lockdown,"The past few months have been eye-opening for many of us. While we knew the internet is an integral part of entertainment and even work for most of us, the lockdown showed us how it's pretty much enabling our lives right now. It is keeping us all connected, which happens to be one of the most important things during social distancing. The only problem is that everybody is home now and constantly on the internet. Take my family for example. While I try to work, my mother is on a video call with someone, and my younger brother is binging Netflix shows. 

We're never alone at home anymore, and it is probably why you've been noticing an internet slowdown in the last couple of months. Let's explain further.



Why has mobile internet been slow lately?There are two major reasons for mobile internet slowdown during the lockdown. First is, of course, the excess load as mentioned earlier. Everybody is on the internet all the time, and that is bound to show some effects. The second reason is less obvious than that. We know mobile networks tend to taper down as we move indoors, and since we are spending almost all our time inside the house, the mobile network just hasn't been that great. 


Is there anything that can be done? 
As a user, there are a few things you can try to 
improve the network. The easiest thing would be to ensure that your phone's battery isn't critically low. A very low charge can affect the processing often resulting in poor reception. Another thing you can do is remove any obstacles between the phone and the nearest cell tower (or just outside when you are indoors). This could mean opening the door or window, removing furniture from the way etc. In fact, removing the phone's cover, if you have one, can help a little as well.

While these could work for some, network providers have a better chance at fixing these problems. To meet the new needs of the consumers, network providers can do a couple of things, the very first being just offering better speeds. Yes, it's that simple. Since we need the internet more than ever now, telecom operators can increase the speeds just a little, and that would make a significant difference. Yes, that would have a financial implication on the provider, but we can all agree that these are pressing times and meeting the consumer demands should be first priority. Secondly, if network providers could solve the indoors network problem, that would be a big help too.

And we know that's possible because that's exactly what 
Airtel did. Not only did Airtel offer faster internet speeds during the lockdown to meet higher demands, but it had also launched the LTE900 technology last year that offers super-fast 4G even in the deeper corners of the house. It was also the first network provider in India to offer Wi-Fi Calling that aims to enable HD calls even from indoors. So, if you're also facing network issues during the lockdown, port to a network provider that proactively takes care of its customers' needs.



How to port a number in the current times? 
Now, if you are considering changing your network provider, you might be wondering if it is even possible right now? And would it be safe?

The answer to both those questions is 'Yes'. Airtel has been 
home delivering SIMs with all precautionary measure during the lockdown. Simply text PORT to 1900 and note down the unique porting code. Then log on to the Airtel website and choose the plan you want, fill in the KYC details and you're done. The SIM will be delivered to your doorstep. 

Now you shouldn't have any network issues, whether you want to get on a work call or just relax and binge watch a new show.

At a time like this, Pearl Academy, India’s leading creative education institute, decided to step ahead and it conducted the portfolio presentations, jury and other assessment exams online this year. It has recently concluded the final year juries and assessments for the graduating batch of 2020 and end-of-year assessment for other students enrolled in various programs. This is a milestone achievement as according to various reports, a large number of educational institutions are struggling to continue with the academic cycle due to COVID-19.


A total of 1270 final year students and 2028 non-final year students appeared for Pearl Academy’s online assessments. More than 150 virtual juries assessed students’ portfolios and projects. The list of these external jury members include Meher Castelino, pioneer of fashion journalism in India; Rahul Vijay, Senior Fashion Stylist at GQ; Neeti Singh, Design Head, Genesis Colors, Farhana Farook, Managing Editor, Filmfare magazine; brand consultant Shubho Sengupta and Alpana Khare, design consultant with Delhi Urban Arts Commission.

In addition to this, 26 external examiners from around the world were engaged to validate the quality standards and the scores, and share their feedback with the students. The institute has also tied up with ARTSTHREAD, an international platform for designers, where portfolios of the graduating students will be on display.

“In the current circumstances, this is a big achievement for the students and the academic team. We did not want COVID-19 to jeopardize the education of our students and worked on a two-pronged strategy to mitigate its impact. We shifted to online teaching and learning since the beginning of the lockdown and simultaneously started preparing to conduct theoretical and practical examinations as per the schedule but in virtual mode”, said Professor Nandita Abraham, President, Pearl Academy.


The virtual campus

Ever since the lockdown 3300 students of the academy are undertaking 1600 online classes every week with 340 faculty members in design, fashion, contemporary media and new-age business.

Masterclasses for the students have been organized with experts from renowned international universities such as Royal College of Art, Manchester Metropolitan University and Solent Southampton University.

Exclusive industry sessions have been conducted for Pearl Academy students with Snapchat India, WACOM, Association of Designers of India (ADI), Fashion Revolution and Event and Entertainment Management Association (EEMA); Amazon India, Lifestyle and many more.

“I am happy with the way my professors at Pearl Academy have mentored and engaged with me during this lockdown period. The virtual classes and assignments have kept me, my classmates occupied, and we have utilized this time to enhance our knowledge by pursuing additional online courses on Coursera, facilitated by my institute”, said Kunwar Thapar, a student of Fashion Communication, School of Contemporary Media, Pearl Academy.

Tech-enabled education has always been a priority at Pearl Academy and it invested in the right learning management systems, digitalization of the curriculum and training of faculty members in virtual teaching five years ago. “We never imagined a scenario like COVID-19 but knew that technology will play an integral role in providing enhanced and immersive learning experiences to the millennials. The agility and adaptability of the students has been commendable,” added Nandita.

Pearl Academy’s entrance examination for the next session is on 18 July and the last date to apply is 13 July. To apply log on to

Union ministers Nirmala Sitharaman, Narendra Singh Tomar, Ram Vilas Paswan and Piyush Goel attended the meeting, which was chaired by Shah. The meeting began around 5.30 pm and was still on at the time of filing of the report. The Home minister called the meeting soon after the Prime minister in his address to the nation announced the extension of Pradhan Mantri Garib Kalyan Anna Yojana (PMGKAY) till November to provide 5 kg free rice or wheat to each member of a beneficiary family along with 1 kg gram (chana) to each family per month. As the scheme would continue to remain applicable from July till November, it is learnt, the GoM is discussing the management and implementation of the PMGKAY scheme. During this five-month period, more than 80 crore people will be provided free ration per month and the government will spend more than Rs 90,000 crore on the same.

In fact, eight lakh customers over a span of 22 years is a testimony. In its 5th generation, Honda City returns with distinctive looks, thanks to several points of resemblance with the Civic. For instance, the new pair of headlamps with nine vertically stacked LEDs surrounded by a strip on top which doubles up as turn indicator and a profuse amount of chrome offering an elegant nose lend a new design theme. Move to the sides, a Japanese sword-inspired shoulder line and 16-inch diamond-cut alloys exude premium-ness to the right extent. The increase in length is noticeable, which has resulted in better in-cabin space, with chrome finished door handles and sloping rear third. Interestingly, the 4th and 5th generations will be on sale in parallel. Move to the rear, the wrap-around tail lamps look striking along with a neatly designed boot. Step inside and the roominess on offer is something you will certainly appreciate. Longest and widest in the segment, Honda City packs plush interiors, easily affording three people in the second row. The cabin is well-appointed, feature-loaded, and spacious. The infotainment head is all-new, slick to use with 32 Alexa-enabled features. A faux-wooden panel runs across the front panel, however, much like the Hyundai Verna and Maruti Suzuki Ciaz employs hard plastic at places around the cabin. Wide widescreen, a nicely-weighed steering wheel, and low slung profile ensure a dynamic ride. The 1.5-litre i-VTEC petrol engine in BS6-compliance drives supremely smooth. The refined motor is paired with either a 6-speed manual or a 7-speed CVT. The free-flowing manual transmission is highly engaging. The CVT, on the other hand, feels much better than others in the market. The peppy petrol motor offers solid low-end torque and an equally strong top end. The CVT, however, turns noisy and showcases rubber band effect when pushed to the redline. In case, you wish to opt for a Diesel engine, the 5th generation is the only choice. The petrol motor has claimed efficiency figures up to 16 kmpl while the diesel belts out up to 24 kmpl. City, now, borrows the lane-assist camera from Civic as well, as part of the standard safety equipment package. Honda City in its 5th generation is a charm, all set to reclaim the pole position. That said, City wouldn't just be hoping to pin down Hyundai Verna and Maruti Suzuki Ciaz, but an array of SUVs capturing the market swiftly. In Video:2020 Honda City review",Anirban Mitra

""Today chief secretary has written a letter to Central home secretary regarding metro and flight services. Like international flights have been stopped till July 15. We requested restriction of domestic flights from hotspots and to start metro for people engaged in essential services, ""West Bengal CM said.  Earlier today, Prime Minister Modi announced that his government will extend till the end of November, the Pradhan Mantri Garib Kalyan Ann Yojana, under which foodgrains are being provided to the poor and needy.  ""The scheme will provide 80 crore people with free grains, will now be applicable in July, August, September, October and November too. The government, during these five months, will give each family member 5-kilogram wheat or 5-kilogram rice free of cost, apart from this each family will get free one kg of chana (chickpeas) too every month,"" he said.  The Prime Minister further said that the extension of this scheme will require an additional expense of Rs 90,000 crore. ",

https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/spotlight/how-are-you-keeping-your-home-clean/articleshow/76419682.cms,2020-06-17 15:58:00,How are you keeping your home clean?,"Cleanliness has always been a crucial part of our lives, however, with the continued spread of COVID-19, this simple habit has become more important and prominent than ever before. People are going above and beyond to ensure that their homes are safe and sanitized. But there are still some questions that leave us startled. How can we keep our floors spick and span? What is the procedure to sanitise packaged goods? And perhaps, the most important of all, how do we clean the groceries and produce that we buy? 


 Well, there are various cleaning agents that have been helping people in this process- some manufactured, others easily concocted at home. And here are the top five things that you can do to keep your home clean. 

 
Mop Your Way To Clean Floors
 

 The first and foremost thing that each one of us should do is sweep our house daily. The WHO and CDC recommend using bleach-based floor cleaners that work well on all types of germs including bacteria and virus. Making this switch and investing in a sturdy mop is a great way to ensure that you can keep your home-floors clean without much hassle. 


Cleaning Your Produce
 

While most people clean packaged goods with cleaning wipes and disinfectant, most people are confused about the right way to clean vegetables and fruits. India’s leading FMCG brand, Marico answered this question with a unique product that has become extremely popular since the lockdown - Veggie Clean. A 100% naturally derived, chlorine/alcohol & 
soap-free vegetables & fruit cleaner, Veggie Clean promises to remove 99.9% germs, pesticides, waxes and soil present on the surface of fruits and vegetables without leaving any residue or odour of its own. 

 Washing vegetables and fruits is often a battle since we cannot use soap and the chemicals in regular disinfectant leave us with little to no option. However, Veggie Clean is a great solution for this purpose and is set to make our veggies and fruits much safer to consume, even in salads and dressings. It is extremely easy to use, as you can add one capful of the solution to 2 litres of water and soak the produce in it. You can then rub the pieces & rinse out the veggies and fruits under running water for 30 seconds, and use them safely. Veggie clean is currently available in two SKUs - 200 ml and 400 ml for ₹99 and ₹199 respectively and can easily be purchased at leading e-commerce sites. You can

The Right Way To Do The Laundry
 

 Washing our clothes in the most efficient and safe way is also a huge concern in the current times. While giving our clothes to laundries is not an option right now, the simple step that we can take is adding a dash of disinfectant into the machine or the bucket (in case of hand-washing) when the clothes are being soaked. In addition to this, it is a great practice to avoid vigorously shaking or dragging out laundry baskets, so as to avoid dispersing any germs and viruses into the air. 

 
Doors & Windows
 

 While we can keep the inside of our homes clean, it is crucial that we also sanitise the areas that are often exposed to others. Wiping down your window sills, that you often come in contact with, and cleaning door handles with disinfectants is a good practice to follow. In addition to this, using handy tools to open and close doors when we do step outside is a great investment to make. 

 
Your hands
 

And last but not the least, there are a lot of tips and tricks that we have already read about on the most effective way of keeping your hands clean. However, the easiest method to follow is washing your hands as often as you need, when you are home. Additionally, wearing gloves when you step out, using sanitizers if you touch a surface, and avoiding touching your mask when outside are all very effective ways of maintaining utmost safety. 

 We hope that these tips and tricks help you in keeping your home and yourself as safe and clean as possible.

After all, it’s a match that was not obvious to most. Singh has a certain signature style that is rooted in India’s textile tradition and minimalism.

It is this sensibility that is not an instant fit to brand Satya Paul. But to say that it’s not exciting would be an under statement. Singh admits to being as excited with this collaboration and says that it’s not that much a leap of faith. “I have been familiar with the work of Mr Paul ever since I was a student. It’s the legacy of this brand and his work with it that really excites me.”

The iconic ’80s label – now managed by Reliance Brands – was known for its experimentation especially with prints. With collaborations from Disney to SH Raza, the brand did break many rules. But as with everything with time, it needed a fresh lease of life. And Singh’s aesthetic might just be the proverbial shot in the arm. “My objective is to make it one of the finest Indian brands. I have known the brand for over 30 years and I am aware of the work that Mr Paul was doing and of the rules he was breaking. Though things changed, the idea is to go back to the real soul of Paul and reinterpret it or edit it to make it more relevant for today,” he says.

Getting creative directors on board is a bona fide fashion business strategy that can transform a fashion house’s image and boost business. Hedi Slimane’s stint at Saint Laurent or the wonders Phoebe Philo created with Celine are cases in point. In fact, the role of a creative director has only become more complex, evolving to include store strategy, social media and advertising campaigns, and global brand vision. While Singh didn’t elaborate on the full spectrum of his involvement, as a creative director he’s obviously charting a new course for the brand – maybe not completely off the course. The idea, he notes is to not deviate from the Satya Paul DNA completely.

As with all his designs, textiles and working with the artisans will be the way forward. He says that the textile work and innovations will soon be seen in the next few collections. Despite sustainability being an overused term, the operations are going to be more mindful. He adds, “Regarding mindful consumption/production, things have changed and hopefully for the better on the whole.”

A line of menswear shirts are already available on their website and he aims to come out with the first ready to wear collection for men and women complete with accessories in October. On the current scenario in the fashion world Singh says, “There’s a lot of gloom and doom around and this news has been exciting for the fashion business on the whole. There’s new energy and a feeling that things can still happen, will happen, we will carry on.”

I had met a man on a train nearly 7 years ago and we shared our numbers and we used to chat, but not regularly. I got married but my marriage didn't last long and I got divorced. The person whom I met on the train always wanted to meet me, and although I agreed to meet him, I never did so. We are not in touch in a regular way. It was more like formal correspondence. Later, after years of my divorce, he suddenly called me and we were talking about our lives and he said he loves me. He said it was love at first sight, but he is married and have a kid. According to him, he never loved his wife because it was a forceful marriage and he wanted to separate from his wife within months after getting married and left her at her parents' house. But later they came to know she is pregnant and he left his job and never visited her till childbirth and he got her back because of the child as he loves kids. They are not in good terms and they hardly have any physical relationship. According to him, they have sex like once in six months. Now he wanted to come out of the marriage but he doesn't have money to give her alimony and his family is not supportive. His family doesn't visit him because when his mother was bedridden, his wife never took care of her and she had to depend on outside food. Now he wants to marry me. I don't know whether to believe him or not. Please tell me whether I should trust him or not? Will I be able to marry him in the future although he isn't divorced yet?

Response by Rachana Awatramani: Will you be able to marry him? This is a question that only you two can answer. Do you want to marry him? Does he want to marry you? Are you working towards that? Are some questions you can ask yourself right now and reflect upon. 


I comprehend that you got divorced as your marriage did not last long and now there is a person in your life who loves you, however, he is married and has a kid. Even though he and his wife are facing certain challenges he is still in the marriage and I understand that you are considering marrying him and he also expresses the same interest. Nevertheless, he does not have money to give in alimony and he does not have support from his family. I can understand that it is difficult for him and as well as for you because there are different challenges that both of you are facing and you both are unable to be with each other. It can be frustrating. 


I would recommend that you spend some time with yourself and clarify your thoughts and understand what exactly you want. Write down the pros and cons of your relationship. Get clarity in your thoughts about your personal goals and then you share them with your boyfriend. Tell him this is what you want and what he can do about it. If he is willing to be with you and is in an unhappy marriage he would work on the situation accordingly. He might require time to do that and therefore you can decide on the timeline and work together as a team to achieve what you both want for this relationship. 


Any outcome of this situation can be challenging for you, hence you need to be prepared for the same. He might not be able to leave his wife due to his attachment with the child. For having clarity for yourself and aligning your goals you can visit a counselor who can help you in this process. 


Long term relationships require a huge investment of time and emotions, it is always difficult for someone to go through the process of divorce especially when a child is involved. I am sure you would know this as you have yourself gone through a similar process. Ending a relationship is challenging nevertheless if he is not happy and they don't have a good relationship he will need to take that call and you can be there as a support with some defined boundaries for yourself.

https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/life-style/books/reviews/micro-review-the-guest-list-by-lucy-foley/articleshow/76616105.cms,2020-06-29 08:30:00,Micro review: 'The Guest List' by Lucy Foley,"'The Guest List' is another hard to solve whodunnit by Lucy Foley which will keep you guessing til the end!

The book is centered around the wedding of Jules Keegan and Will Slater. Jules is an ambitious magazine publisher and an incredibly demanding bride while Will is a rising TV star with some skeletons in his closet. They're both selfish and easy to dislike, which all the perspective characters make clear. They have chosen an island with eerie folklore to have their wedding and during the ceremony, the lights go out and someone is found dead.

The story is told from multiple perspectives across two timelines, the present and two days before the wedding. Despite it sounding confusing, the different character perspectives flow together quite smoothly to form a riveting narrative. The book isn't a fast-paced thriller with constant shocks to keep you hooked but a slow burn reveal, where an overlooked word might have clued you in to the murderer. Even those who read a lot of mysteries will have a hard time guessing the murderer of this book, making it a great read for all mystery lovers. 



How critics view the book:

""Great fun. Lucy Foley is really very clever"", said author
 Anthony Horowitz.

""Both a classic whodunnit and a very contemporary psychological thriller that left me guessing right to the end – a wonderful read"", praised

There was a small stage set up in the garden with a barricade for the special guests. MJ walked down from his suite and stood on the improvised stage with his bodyguards. There was silence and sense of awe among the selected guests. I was looking at this magician who had enthralled and hypnotised the entire universe with his electrifying performances. He was just few feet away from me. I wanted to capture this moment. So I broke the barricade jumped on the stage and almost hugged MJ.

His untimely death has shocked the entire nation and his fans. Reports suggest that he was in depression and was being treated for the same. Currently, his death case is being investigated by the Mumbai Police.

 Recently, his alleged girlfriend Rhea Chakraborty was summoned by the police to record her official statement since she was staying with him during lockdown. She was interrogated for almost nine hours. His close friends Mukesh Chhabra and Rohini Iyer have also recorded their official statements. 

 Today, Sushant’s co-star Sanjana Sanghi, who will make her debut in ‘Dil Bechara’, was seen at Bandra police station. She will be interrogated in his death case since she is Sushant’s co-star in his last film. Check out the video here:

 Recently, Sanjana took to her Instagram account and shared a few pictures with Sushant from the sets. Sharing it with the fans, she also penned an emotional note as she remembered him. Her post read, “Whoever said time helps heal all wounds, was lying. Some feel like they’re being ripped open, again and again, and bleeding - Of moments that now will forever remain memories, Of laughs together that were but will never again be, Of questions that will remain unanswered, Of disbelief, that only keeps growing But these wounds also contain a film, a gift that everyone is yet to see, Wounds that contain dreams, plans, and desires for our country’s children, their education and their future that will be fulfilled, Wounds that contain a passion for an endless creative zest for every artist there is, Wounds that contain the hope for a world that promises to uphold honesty, integrity, kindness and embraces individuality - rid of all toxicity, I vow that I will do everything to make sure each of these dreams are fulfilled, like you always wanted me to. Except, you’d promised we’d do it all together. #SushantSinghRajput #ThinkingOfYou”

We attempt to break down the black, white and the grey surrounding Sushant’s death 
 
THE QUESTIONS AND ALLEGATIONS


1. ‘Contradictions in reports about suicide’
Ever since Sushant’s death, many have raised questions about the case and asked for a thorough investigation. Sushant’s maternal uncle, RC Singh, told the media that he feels there was a conspiracy behind his death.

> A widely-discussed social media post claimed that a person who can support his body weight with his hands cannot die by hanging. In the tweets, which are now deleted, the person said that the “ring along the neck is not slanted. No saliva outside mouth, tongue and eyeball normal., they are not out (sic).” According to the post, “there were only 3 people in the house and all three said that Sushant was hanging with the help of curtain. But the mark made on his neck is of a plastic rope (sic).” 

> In the beginning, there were multiple versions in the media as well if the actor used a curtain, kurta or a bedsheet, leading to confusion. There were reports that claimed that the police also found a bathrobe belt, torn into two parts, lying on the floor. There are divergent reports about whether the door to Sushant’s room was broken down or whether a locksmith was called to open it when he didn’t answer.

> WhatsApp forwards claimed that Sushant had a party at his house the night before and was playing an online game hours before the incident. It also claimed that the CCTV of his building wasn’t working that night and it was suspicious that the actor didn’t leave a suicide note.


2. ‘He succumbed to professional pressure’Many of Sushant’s fans and associates within the industry have cited the ‘insider-outsider’ theory, professional pressure and bullying as some of the reasons that could have led to Sushant’s suicide. 

> In a tweet, politician Sanjay Nirupam claimed that Sushant lost seven films in six months and the industry’s “ruthlessness took the life of one talented person.” Abhishek Kapur, who had worked with Sushant in two films, termed the actor’s treatment by the film fraternity a “systematic dismantling of a fragile mind”. Meanwhile, director Shekhar Kapur, whose YRF-backed film 'Paani' with Sushant was shelved, tweeted, “I knew the pain you were going through. I knew the story of the people that let you down so bad that you would weep on my shoulder.”

  I knew the pain you were going through. I knew the story of the people that let you down so bad that you would weep on my shoulder. I wish Iwas around the last 6 months. I wish you had reached out to me. What happened to you was their Karma. Not yours. #SushantSinghRajput— Shekhar Kapur (@shekharkapur) June 15, 2020 
 


> A few days after Sushant’s demise, a police case was filed by lawyer Sudhir Kumar Ojha in a Bihar court against eight people, including Karan Johar, Sanjay Leela Bhansali, Salman Khan, Ekta Kapoor and Aditya Chopra. “In the complaint, I have alleged that Sushant Singh Rajput was removed from around seven films and some of his films were not released. Such a situation was created which forced him to take the extreme step,” Ojha said. 

> Sushant Singh Rajput’s cousin Niraj Kumar Bablu said, “As far as the case is concerned, there are big personalities in the industry, who have spoken about the behaviour of Bollywood with Sushant. So, we definitely feel that there was some pressure on him from Bollywood.”


3. ‘Sushant had relationship troubles’
Some have been speculating that Sushant was having trouble in his personal life. 

> Sushant was reportedly in a relationship with Rhea Chakraborty. A report claims that apparently she had a spat with Sushant a few days before his death and moved out. Suhrita, a work associate of Rhea’s, wrote in an FB post that the two had problems because of Sushant’s mental health issues. She has also been quoted as saying that Rhea broke up with him.
 


> A report claimed that Sushant’s psychiatrist apparently said that Sushant regretted breaking up with former girlfriend Ankita Lokhande.


4. 
‘Sushant’s death is related to the recent showbiz suicide cases’
A conspiracy theory circulating on social media suggests that there is some link between four recent suicides in the showbiz industry, the last being Sushant’s. These include the suicides of TV actors Manmeet Grewal and Preksha Mehta and Sushant’s former manager Disha Salian, who died a few days before him.


5. 
‘Social media accounts being tampered with’ 
  
 There have been reports of changes in Sushant’s social media accounts since his death. The number of accounts being followed by the actor’s Instagram account reduced. This has been questioned by MP Roopa Ganguly as well. Nilotpal, a family friend of the actor, has sent a letter to the police, urging them to interrogate Sandip Ssingh (the actor’s close friend and film producer) over allegedly deleted posts. He has requested the police to have Sandip’s phone checked to find out if he has tampered with Sushant’s social media accounts. 


WHAT WE CAN VERIFY SO FAR
1. Suicide suspected, haven’t come to final conclusion yet: PoliceSushant’s detailed post-mortem report says he died by “asphyxia due to hanging”. The final report said, “No signs of any struggle before death, nothing found from his nails”. DCP Abhishek Trimukhe of Mumbai Police told BT, “We are investigating the case from every 
angle and haven’t come to a final conclusion. Abhi tak ka jo investigation hai uss basis par maine jaankaari di hai. Jo doctors ka kehna hai... normally, koi kisi ko maarta hai toh struggle marks hote hain, jo nahi hai. So, we suspect that it’s a suicide. However, we have not completed our investigation, and it’s still on.”
 

In a recent media briefing he had said, “We have received the detailed post-mortem report, which was conducted by a team of five doctors. The actor’s cause of death has been clearly stated by the doctors as asphyxia due to hanging. The rest of the samples collected have been sent for analysis. We have requested the forensic team to conduct the analysis on a priority basis. The police are probing every angle in the case.”


2. 
Probing professional angle, looking at his contracts: Police
Police have not yet come to a conclusion on this issue and they are probing whether professional rivalry or any kind of pressure due to his work dealings was responsible for the actor’s extreme step. 

> Maharashtra Home Minister tweeted on June 15, “While the post mortem report says actor @itsSSR committed suicide by hanging himself, there are media reports that he allegedly suffered from clinical depression because of professional rivalry. @MumbaiPolice will probe this angle too.”
 


> 27 people have been questioned by the police in the case till now. Mukesh Chhabra, who directed the late actor’s last film 'Dil Bechara', friend and owner of a celeb management company Rohini Iyer, friend and supposed flatmate Siddharth Pithani, Aashish Singh, Director-Original Films at Netflix and formerly of YRF, 'Dil Bechara' co-star Sanjana Sanghi and filmmaker and friend Sandip Ssingh are among those who have been questioned. 

> Sushant’s work contracts are being looked at closely, as part of the investigation. Last week, Yash Raj Films (YRF) had submitted to the police copies of the contract signed by the late actor for their projects. DCP Trimukhe said, “Initially, unka jab career shuruat hua, unko kuch movies mil chuki thi, uske baad Yash Raj ke saath unhone contract sign kiya tha. Unke kya terms of business thay, kaise woh contract handle hua, kya hua, iss baare mein police investigate kar rahi hai.” On Saturday, casting director Shanoo Sharma, who works with YRF, was questioned. Sushant has been a part of two films made by the banner – 'Shuddh Desi Romance' (2013) and Detective 'Byomkesh Bakshy!' (2015). According to a report, representatives of more production houses are likely to be called by the police for questioning. 

> On the work front, Sushant had several projects in hand. Besides a film directed by Rumy Jafry that was to co-star Rhea Chakraborty, Sushant was said to be in talks for Sandip Ssingh’s directorial debut 'Vande Bharatam', Oscar winner Resul Pookutty’s film titled 'Sarpakal' and a movie with filmmaker Anand Gandhi. His upcoming film, 'Dil Bechara', will soon have an OTT release.


3. ‘Sushant was planning to get married’
According to reports, Rhea in her statement to the police said that the two were planning to settle down by the end of 2020. Rhea and Sushant were all set to work together for the first time as well in a film directed by Rumy Jafry, who said that he last spoke to the two in the first week of June and had no idea about any issue between them.
 


> A cousin of Sushant’s confirmed to media that the actor was to get married this year. Another report quoted Sushant and Rhea’s broker who said that the two were looking for a house to live in and had revealed their marriage plans.

>Sushant’s psychiatrist rubbished reports about Sushant regretting his break-up with Ankita Lokhande. In a post, he wrote that he had “not even made a statement” as that would be unethical and would break client-therapist confidentiality.


4. No link between the suicides: Police
Talking about the speculation of any possible link between Sushant and Disha’s deaths, DCP Trimukhe said, “It’s just a theory. I have spoken to the concerned DCP where Disha Salian’s suicide has taken place, but there is no link between the two. Yes, Disha Salian had met Sushant once and in the last phase, he was managed by Uday. Disha was in Uday’s team and working for Sushant. Besides that, there is no link.” No verifiable link could be established between the two TV actors and Sushant either.


5. Family is maintaining Sushant’s handlesSushant’s Instagram account was memorialised last week. In a statement released recently, the family said, “From now on, we intend to maintain his Instagram, Twitter and Facebook page as legacy accounts to keep his memories alive.” As per Instagram’s policy, no changes can be made in a memorialised account. However, the number of accounts being followed by Sushant’s handle did reduce post his account being memorialised – something which has not been explained clearly yet.

Since I could not fly down to Jaipur, I took help of technology. To keep my dada busy I started playing chess with him. There is an app through which people in different cities can play the game together. And we used to play chess twice a day. Also I kept him engaged through online videos and films. I used to select and share the link with him. And like a kid he used to wait for what I am going to share with him. What he loved was paying through e wallet pay. I remember when I taught him to pay without stepping out he loved it very much. He is very happy that he has learnt so much during the past couple of months and become very active. He is becoming a gadget freak now and I am happy that I succeeded in keeping him busy despite being so far from him in terms of physical distance.

The actress feels that the last leg of 2019 had fatigued her and she was looking forward to a short break, which eventually turned out to be rather long. 

“Towards the end of 2019, I was busy with Sanjivani’s new edition on TV. It kept me busy; in fact juggling all the commitments at that time made me feel overworked. I wanted a break and I would have taken it during the summer months. So, well, I did get the time I needed with my children and my husband but we had to cancel our annual holiday this year. I used the extra time on hand at home to read and cook, exercise and also check out social media,” says Gurdip, recalling her last few months at home. 

When asked what the lockdown has taught her, Gurdip says, “You cannot plan anything. We had given mother Earth a lot of beating. Nature is signalling us to stop doing that. Natural disasters around the world have indicated that the earth is refusing to take any more of our callousness. We were in a rat race but now, it’s important to think and act wisely, bond with those who matter and make memories.” 

A few months ago, Gurdip had returned to the small screen after a break with the new season of Sanjivani, the show that once made her a household name. “I had never left TV, ever,” she says, adding, “I have been working, though I have taken short sabbaticals when I was having my babies. I wanted to be with my kids. I resumed when I could. Like I did two cookery shows on TV which have a good shelf life even with a stipulated amount of episodes. Those shows helped me strike a balance between home and work. I also learnt a lot and for once, it was me on TV and not a character.” 

Gurdip considers Sanjivani 2, which went off air a few months ago, a reward for herself. “I have not seen another TV actor coming back to a show she debuted with 18 years ago. Sanjivani is a very important show for me because for many, I am still Dr Juhi. My daughter used to wonder why people called me Dr Juhi till Sanjivani 2 came on air. I got married to Arjun (Punjj) while working on the show. Sadly, the second season didn’t do well and I don’t know what went wrong. TV is unpredictable. There was a time when shows ran for years and today, a year or even nine months on air is an achievement. As an artiste, I also feel that TV needs to reinvent itself with more interesting content. It does not have to be regressive, even while catering to a rural audience. I hope people use this time to bring in some much-needed changes in our systems. For instance, having scripts ready beforehand, being prepared with pre-production. Sanjivani 2 was a fulfilling experience for me but I wish it lasted a little longer.”

She further related her woes and shared how she had placed her faith in the doctor, but it is her attitude that got to her and shook her up.

Talking about her doctor, Chhavi shared, ""She said some things which I could not respond to at that time, but they will remain engraved in my mind forever. This person who was with me thru this journey of 9+ months.. this person who had seen my strengths & weaknesses, who had seen me naked physically and emotionally. She told me, “your labour is not strong enough, your body is not meant to do this, if you felt pain, you would be screaming, not sleeping.” That was the first time I realised that she was never onboard the hypno-birthing to begin with. If she was, she would believe in the power of self-hypnosis. The months that I had spent practicing it… I couldn’t believe my ears when she beamed with pride, “Don’t worry, I’m famous for giving really small incisions. You won't have a big scar!"" I couldn't believe that after all this, she thought that a scar is what I was worried about.""

 

 
            View this post on Instagram           CHAPTER 3- THE WORST WAS YET TO COME Due to the panic attack post the drug, my dilation completely stopped. I failed to go back into hypnosis. For the next 7 hours I felt no progress. At 1pm, I was put on pitocin, my surges started coming every 30 sec & lasted for 2 min each. I was in excruciating pain, but still determined to bring my baby into the world naturally. I started dilating again & 2 hrs later I was 8 cm dilated. But my doctor came in & said she’d like to take me for a C-section. I put my complete faith in her and agreed to whatever she said. But her attitude towards my whole birthing process completely shook me up. She said some things which I could not respond to at that time, but they will remain engraved in my mind forever.

I couldn't believe that after all this, she thought that a scar is what I was worried about. And then suddenly, as if there was no time left, within minutes a wheelchair came to wheel me into the OT, the staff disappeared, the other doctors came, and it all felt surreal. I remember I had to go to the loo, and when Mohit was taking me, me walking at a snail’s pace due to the pain, my doctor came shouting from behind, “abhi ye sab chhodo.. seedha catheter lagayenge.. jaldi karo”. Mohit just stared at her in disbelief and said, “doctor she just needs to pee. Please give her time”. I heard a “tch” from the background & she stormed out.

In a short span of time, Parth Samthaan and Erica Fernandes have become the most loved jodi on television. The two have several fan clubs dedicated to them. There were also rumours of them dating earlier, though both have chosen to remain mum about it.

 Yaaron and 
Tadap Tadap, is still a renowned name among youngsters. The multilingual singer, who loves performing live and yet keeps a low profile, visited Indore for a college fest recently, where we caught up with him for a quick chat. 

Excerpts...

 
 


Your song from Dus Bahane from 2005, has recently been remixed for Baaghi 3. Many other hit songs are being remade these days. What is your opinion on this?

I hadn’t really expected
 Dus Bahane to be remixed, because it was already quite a peppy song that had a great rhythm. Having said that, we know it was a hit, so if a song is a hit, it has more recall value and a sure shot success rate. However, I’m not a remix guy, and I wouldn’t do or want a remix of my songs. Once a song is done, lived its life, one need not bring it back as a remix. Plus there’s no dearth of talent right now, there’s a lot of fresh music too. I don’t know why there is a fixation with remixes. It maybe because of the nostalgia associated with it. But earlier, music directors would pick at least a 20-30 year old song to remix, whereas now I think even a 10 year old song would do. I feel it is mostly the massy songs with upbeat music and not much focus on lyrics, that are replayed and remade.



You entered the industry in 1996 and have worked with almost every music director. How do you think the music scene has evolved?
I have seen lot of genres come and go. I feel lucky to still be relevant after all these years. Today, as much as I dislike social media, it has become a launch platform for many new singers. TikTok and YouTube have given opportunities to many, and I say if you’re good, then why not. 


 
 

You were a judge on a reality show when the trend had just about started. Now there are many shows of the same format with a winner each year. Do you think it has made it easier for artistes?
While there are many who win these shows, not everyone gets offers for playback singing. It takes time. Arijit Singh is a great singer who came from a reality show, but it took him so many years to breakthrough. Yet, artistes these days are much smarter than I was at their age. They start picking up small shows and concerts and once they start seeing money, then they focus on that. However, they don’t catch a break and try to cram in as many shows as possible. I feel, they should strike a balance and look at a larger picture.

Jigar Saraiya, one half of Bollywood composer duo Sachin-Jigar, is all set to feature in a pop music video with gorgeous Sanjeeda Shaikh. Titled
 Ruka Hoon, this romantic single marks Jigar’s Hindi pop solo debut.
The video for the single has been shot in Istanbul, Turkey. Composed by Sachin-Jigar and written and sung by Jigar with a breezy hook-line, 
Ruka Hoon definitely has the power to stop you in your tracks.
In fact, it had the same effect on Sanjeeda as well. She says, “When I was approached to feature in the video, I knew I had to, as the song is very me. This is actually the kind of music I listen and jam to. It has a sweet sound and is yet, incredibly addictive. Believe me, 
Ruka Hoon will surely be topping the list of everybody’s favourites. Also, Jigar is so super-talented.”
Adds Jigar, “Sanjeeda looks like a dream. She is immensely talented. It’s almost like I made it keeping her in mind.”

Further, coming to the video, it is for the very first time that Neha Kakkar and Jaani are featuring together in a music video. Both these artists have been known for their musical collaborations, but Jaani never made an appearance in a song. However, the pattern has been broken, and the chemistry as well as the intensity that Jaani and Neha Kakkar have brought to the video, is applaud worthy.

While the former is a serious drama on police brutality in prison, the latter is a quirky comedy. After playing a supporting role alongside Mahesh Babu in Maharshi, Naresh is returning to his forte of comedy in Bangaru Bullodu.

Starring the gorgeous Pooja Jhaveri as the leading lady, the teaser of Bangaru Bullodu features the protagonist as an employee in a Gold Finance Company. While a series of comedy bits dominate the initial proceedings, the robbery in the town and Ajay Ghosh’s entry as a police officer makes the plot more interesting with a blend of fun and emotional sequences. Set against a rural backdrop, the film casts a bunch of comedians like Posani Krishna Murali, Vennela Kishore, Prudhvi Raj and others.

 Directed by PV Giri and bankrolled by Anil Sunkara under AK Entertainments, the shooting of the comedy entertainer has been wrapped up a long time ago and with the on-going corona crisis, the release has been postponed.

 After playing the protagonist in more than 50 films, Allari Naresh turned into a supporting artist in 2019 and played the pivotal role of Ravi Shankar in Mahesh Babu’s 25th film ‘Maharshi’. His upcoming film Naandhi will showcase him in a never-seen-before role of an undertrial prisoner.

Talented Mollywood actor Bala recently lashed out at creators of fake news who had been circulating rumours about him getting remarried. Taking to his official Facebook handle, Bala has cleared the air about his marriage rumours and also warned people who were behind the fake news.

Bala said that he usually keeps his phone on at night as his parents are back in Chennai, his father is sick, but he cannot travel to Chennai, as it is riskier if he becomes a carrier of the pandemic. So the actor makes sure that he is available on phone all the time, but due to messages and calls he has been getting since evening, he slipped into sleep by early morning for about 15 minutes. The actor’s mother called him and he didn’t notice the call. “Those 15 minutes are like a day for them. That much of pain and tension. She wasn’t able to contact me over the phone,” Bala said in the video.

Bala said that this has triggered him to respond to the fake news and he also said that this was the last warning for people who are circulating such fake news for their monetary benefits. “My last and final warning to certain people. I truly love my fans if anybody tries to play with my fans i will be the 1st person to stand in front. here is the actual truth. god bless all with love bala,” he penned sharing the video.


Check out the video.

The Congress hit out at the PM for failing to address the key issues of giving China a strong statement on the border standoff and taking firm steps to deal with the coronavirus pandemic. The Left parties said extending the PMGKAY scheme is not enough as the quantity should have been doubled to prevent hunger deaths. Congress leader Rahul Gandhi took a jibe at the prime minister with an urdu couplet -- ""Tu idhar udhar ki na baat kar, ye bataa ki kaafila kaise lutaa"" -- for not mentioning China in his address. Ahead of PM's address, Rahul Gandhi in a video message said the government should transfer Rs 7,500 into the bank accounts of the poor immediately, a demand raised by him and his party numerous times. Rahul Gandhi also asked Modi when and how will he throw out the Chinese army from Indian territory. In his address, PM Modi announced that the PMGKAY, a free ration scheme, would be extended for 80 crore people till the November end. Under the scheme, initially rolled out for three months, five kg of wheat or rice and one kg of pulses will be given free of cost to the poor every month. Underlining that Modi is leading the country with alertness and sensitivity, BJP chief J P Nadda said the PM should be lauded for saving lives and livelihood amid this pandemic. He described the extension of PMGKAY as a visionary step. ""Prime Minister Modi stood like a rock at the time of this crisis and had the courage to transform challenges into opportunities. We are grateful to him for extending the free supply of foodgrains to the poor in the country amid this pandemic till Diwali and Chhath puja,"" Nadda said in a tweet. Union home minister Amit Shah also attributed the extension of PMGKAY to Modi's visionary leadership and thanked farmers and honest taxpayers, saying their hard work and dedication were helping the benefits reach the poor. ""The extension of Garib Kalyan Anna Yojana shows the sensitivity of Prime Minister Narendra Modi to the millions of poor and his commitment for their welfare. Nobody slept hungry in a large country like India during the Corona period, thanks to Modiji's foresight and successful implementation of the scheme,"" Shah said in a tweet. Congress spokesperson Supriya Shrinate accused PM Modi of doing headline management and said Modi did not look the ""enemy"" in the eye, which was expected of him after a bloody standoff with China in Ladakh on June 15. ""Our biggest expectation was that the PM will gather the courage and the will to look at China in the eye and reply to the enemy. Take the enemy head-on and make a very strong statement against what China is doing. But the PM once again shied away,"" she said. The Congress has been demanding Modi to name China as ""aggressor"" and send a strong message to it after 20 Indian soldiers were killed in violent clash with Chinese troops. On Monday, the government banned 59 mobile applications with Chinese links, including TikTok and UC Browser, saying they were prejudicial to sovereignty, integrity and security of the country. ""Bowing to people's protests, the Modi government has extended the provision of 5 kg grains free for 80 crore people for next 5 months. This falls far short of the required 10 kg per month for 6 months to all needy to prevent hunger deaths,"" CPM general secretary Sitaram Yechury said. ""After this announcement extra food grains allocation was only 26 (lakh tonnes) in April & 29 lakh tonnes in May... Modi must release money from the thousands of crores of rupees collected in the private trust fund to combat Covid for free provision of 10 kg grains per month for 6 months to all needy,"" he said. CPI general secretary D Raja asked the government why it was not addressing the issue of universalising the Public Distribution System. He said it took a long time for the PM to understand the devastating effects of the virus. Congress leader Shrinate said, ""Despite all the euphoria and the massive build up, in his 17 minute long speech Shri Narendra Modi made, what at best is an administrative decision"", which could have been done by issuing a notification. She said many had hoped the prime minister would talk about substantive steps to contain the pandemic and putting the economy back on track, but he did not. ""Neither did the prime minister talk about job losses and wage cuts,"" she said, ""nor did he announce the much needed relief to migrant labourers and the poor."" Urging Modi to ensure a cash transfer of Rs 7,500 to the poor, she said he should keep ""raj dharma"" and national interest in mind in doing so. ""There was massive euphoria and build up. At the end of it, the prime minister's address was 'much ado about nothing. We had great expectations from the prime minister. Once again he belied our expectations,"" she said. The congress leader said it seems the top priority of the PM is the Bihar elections.

The actress lauded the move and said, “Government has banned Chinese apps and I think most people are celebrating because China is like we all know it's a communist country and the way they have gone deep into our economy and our system. The data is scary, how much our business was dependent on China and this year apart from being the originator of Corona and giving the world the biggest adversity of recent times. In the midst of this adversity now they are messing with our borders in Ladakh and they don't only want Ladakh. In the scheme of things, they want Arunachal Pradesh, Sikkim. They also want your Assam and it's never ending.""

 Kangana went on to add that it was better to cut China’s roots in India. “You can see the greed of these people and of course even the world is astonished by their ways of life and by the way they ill-treat animals and the way they beat you up if you do idol worshipping or if you follow your religion. I say that you know being an extremist or being a communist, both ways are extreme. Why do you want to believe there is god or there is no god? Why do you want to be so sure? Why can't you just be that you don't know? I don't agree with their ways and obviously they've shown their real crude face to the world also with this pandemic and the bio-war that they've unleashed on the world. What is feeding them is that their economy. So it is definitely better we cut their roots here in India and of course when there will not be so much revenue and money, their evil power will come down and the world will be a better place. China is not the leading power because what leads is also what everyone else suffers their virtues and their sins. Today they are leading power and they have this power that is why the world is suffering,” the actress added.

 Stressing upon the need to go local and encouraging her fans to endorse the idea, Kangana stated, “In ancient times when India led the world and the world was a prosperous and inclusive place, I do believe that we need to go back to that time. India is the right leader whether it is the religion that we follow, whether the diverse nation that we have of many languages and many religions.”

 “Also, the philosophy that Hinduism preaches to the world of inclusiveness. India is the right leader. If these communist people become leaders, capitalist people will become leaders, this is what the world is going to be. All about bio-wars and crude economic gains. So I think India with it's spiritual heritage and history is the right world leader where sacrifice and accepting the world is the philosophy that the whole world is one place and it deserves to be the leader. So I feel that we should encash in these times where China is receiving so much hatred from the world and we should take the charge and as people we should also encourage local stuff and try to see value in what our people do. Of course Chinese give you everything sasta and cheap. We should not go by that. We saw the aftermath of that sasta and cheap. We need to encourage our people and I think this is the right time,” concluded Kangana.

The number of households availing work under the national employment guarantee scheme in these 116 districts in six states, including Bihar and Uttar Pradesh, jumped to 89.83 lakh during May compared to 48.22 lakh in the same month last year, a rise of 86.3 per cent, according to data on the Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Act (MGNREGA) website.

Here is all you need to know about plasma therapy and its effectiveness —Where will be 'plasma bank' set up in Delhi and how will it work?The 'plasma bank' will be set-up at the Institute of Liver and Biliary Sciences in Delhi. Anyone who needs plasma will need a recommendation from a doctor. People can take plasma from relatives and known people. ""It will start in two days. The most important thing is that those who have been cured of coronavirus will have to come forward and donate plasma. People are still doing but now there will be a system made for this,"" Kejriwal said. With a recovery rate of over 58%, more and more people must volunteer to donate their plasma, the CM added. What is Plasma therapy?Plasma (the yellowish liquid component of blood) from a recovered Covid-19 patient contains antibodies that may help fight the disease when infused into the bodies of another person suffering from Covid-19. These antibodies are capable of fighting the virus that causes the illness and also helps in faster recovery. Because it takes a few weeks for antibodies to form, the hope is that transfusing someone else’s antibodies could help patients fight the virus before their immune system kicks in. How successful is the treatment?In Delhi, 29 Covid-19 patients received plasma therapy treatment. ""We did trials on 29 people and the results were very good. Two things happen in corona, one the oxygen level drops and the second is that respiration level increases. It was observed that if the plasma is given then it increases in the level of oxygen and respiration level also decreases,"" Delhi chief minister said. The treatment is in its initial stages and doctors around the world have received mixed reports on treatment's benefits. In New York's Mount Sinai Hospital, 39 patients were treated with plasma therapy. It was observed that people who received the therapy were less likely to die than non-plasma recipients. The Expanded Access Program showed signs of improvement in patients who were administered a single dose of 200mL. Is it a new treatment?Plasma therapy is a century-old remedy that was used to fight infection before modern medicine came along. In 1918, during the outbreak of flu pandemic, plasma therapy was used on patients and the then reports had suggested: ""patients are less likely to die"". Is Delhi government's initiative the first such program?Thousands of coronavirus patients have been treated with plasma therapy across the world. In the US, Mayo Clinic is working in collaboration with industry, academic and government partners for the 'Expanded Access Program'. The program has so far attended over 38,000 patients. ",

The device called '20Sec4Life' will glow, beep and play a musical tone for more than 20 seconds to help people disinfect their hands properly, according to the researchers from Lovely Professional University (LPU) in Punjab. The splash-proof device can be mounted on any liquid soap dispenser and operates using a battery, they said. According to WHO, promoting good hand hygiene is one of the most basic yet powerful tools that countries must leverage to reduce the spread of COVID-9. The new device can help combat the growing number of cases of COVID 19, which in many cases spread due to negligence in observing the 20 seconds hand wash rule, the researchers said. ""COVID 19 is spreading rapidly and one of the reasons for this is improper hygiene habits. For most people, it is difficult to keep a track of time while washing hands,"" Prabin Kumar Das, a B Tech student of Electronics Communication and Engineering at LPU, told PTI. Das and his team developed the device prototypes with four variants, including an advanced model that offers step by step hand-washing instructions in vernacular languages to ensure proper cleaning. The base device is triggered and starts playing music for over 20 seconds when the nozzle of the handwash is pressed to dispense soap. The advanced version of the IoT device can be connected via Wi-Fi network and can be paired and operated through a mobile app. The Internet of things (IoT) is a system of interrelated computing devices with the ability to transfer data over a network without requiring human-to-human or human-to-computer interaction. The expected selling price of the base model post commercialisation is expected to be Rs. 70 per unit, the researchers said. ""We all are in a hurry and do not realise that we have failed to completely disinfect ourselves by not washing our hands for the prescribed duration of 20 seconds,"" Das, who developed the device with his colleagues at LPU, said. ""Therefore, we have come up with a simple solution in the form of 20Sec4Life which will enable people to abide by the prescribed timelines for washing hands,"" he added. ",

The survey was condcuted to check how willing are people when it comes to using metros/local trains, visiting gyms/swimming pools, booking holiday hotel stays, etc in the next month or so. As more than 100,000 new cases were added in the last six days in the country, more and more people are concerned about contracting the virus that has claimed the lives of over half a million people across the world. As many as 67% of the people surveyed said they are unlikely to travel by metro/local trains if the services are resumed in the next 30 days. Though the Central government may be planning to reopen recreation centres such as gymnasiums and swimming pool, there aren't many takers for the proposal. An overwhelming number of people surveyed, 84%, said that they will stay away from these places for some more time. The hospitality industry, one of the hardest-hit countries from the pandemic, is likely to remain in the abyss as people are still reluctant to make bookings to a hotel during holidays. As many as 93% of the respondents said that they will not plan any holiday hotel stay with family in the next three months. The survey was conducted by LocalCircles and received over 24,000 responses from 241 districts of India. ",

The present lockdown in the three states, which have seen an exponential surge in Covid cases in the last few days, was scheduled to end on June 30. Maharashtra CM Uddhav Thackeray made it clear on Sunday that lockdown in the state will not be lifted post June 30, but more relaxations will be given to speed up economic activities. He said even if relaxations are being given, it does not mean that the danger or the crisis has ended. “We are walking on the edge, we have to walk slowly. Just because relaxations are being given, people shouldn’t think that the battle is over. It is not.” His comments came on a day when Mumbai Police issued directives asking people not to venture out more than 2kms from home unless it was for office or for essentials. Police said that all trips — whether for shopping or for exercising or visiting salons — should be made within a 2km-radius “else action will be initiated”. Nakabandis were conducted throughout the city on Sunday to enforce the new directives and nearly 7000 vehicles were impounded by police. “If we find that people are venturing out without any reason or travelling unnecessarily, then we will have no option but to go for the stricter imposition of the lockdown again in the areas with a rise in cases,” the CM added. A senior IPS officer said many people aren’t taking the lockdown seriously. “There have been instances where people living in the distant suburbs have been found strolling on Marine Drive. Beaches are packed with visitors, many of them not wearing masks,” he said. Senior officials in Mantralaya said the state government has given power to the local district collectors and police commissioner to go in for localised lockdowns in certain areas where cases have risen.

He said the decision on dates will be taken in the next three to four days. “There should be a day-long curfew with one or two-hour relaxation to buy essentials. Flights and train services have to be stopped,” he said. Currently, there is only night curfew in the state from 9 pm to 5 am. Health minister Eatala Rajender informed a review meeting chaired by the CM that several health officials and medical experts have suggested another 15-day lockdown in the Greater Hyderabad Municipal Limits to bring the situation under control. Manipur chief minister N Biren Singh said that the government has decided to extend the ongoing lockdown in the state till July 15 with some relaxations. “The government will open inter-district bus services from Wednesday by maintaining SOPs and guidelines,” he said.

https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/coronavirus-symptoms-and-precautions/articleshow/74451114.cms,2020-03-11 15:46:00,Coronavirus symptoms and precautions: All you need to know,"NEW DELHI: The novel coronavirus is now spreading much more rapidly outside China than within the country, leading the world into uncharted territory, but the outbreak can still be contained, the World Health Organization said on Monday. The virus has so far claimed over 3,000 lives and there are over 90,000 confirmed cases.  What is coronavirus?Coronaviruses (CoV) are a large family of viruses that cause illness ranging from the common cold to more severe diseases such as Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS-CoV) and Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS-CoV). A novel coronavirus (nCoV) is a new strain that has not been previously identified in humans. What are zoonotic?Coronaviruses are zoonotic, meaning they are transmitted between animals and people. Detailed investigations found that SARS-CoV was transmitted from civet cats to humans and MERS-CoV from dromedary camels to humans. Several known coronaviruses are circulating in animals that have not yet infected humans. What are the signs of infections?Common signs of infection include respiratory symptoms, fever, cough, shortness of breath and breathing difficulties. In more severe cases, the infection can cause pneumonia, severe acute respiratory syndrome, kidney failure and even death. How to prevent infection from spreading?Standard recommendations to prevent infection spread include regular hand washing, covering mouth and nose when coughing and sneezing, thoroughly cooking meat and eggs. Avoid close contact with anyone showing symptoms of respiratory illness such as coughing and sneezing. Avoid touching your eyes, nose, and mouth. Stay home when you are sick. Clean and disinfect frequently touched objects and surfaces using a regular household cleaning spray or wipe. Who should wear a facemask?It is not necessary for people who are well to wear a facemask to protect themselves from respiratory diseases. Facemasks should be used by people who show symptoms of COVID-19 to help prevent the spread of the disease to others, Centre for Disease Control and Prevention said.

At 18,870, fresh infections reported in the country during the day were the third highest to date, the previous two days having reported the highest counts. The day’s toll from the virus was 415. South India has seen a sharp rise in cases over the past few days. The five southern states, along with UT Puducherry, together accounted for 6,985 new cases on Monday, 37% of the day’s total. On Sunday, the number was 7,150, 36.2% of the total (19,741). By contrast, the share of the south in India’s daily Covid-19 count on the first two days of June was below 22%. Over the past three days, all five southern states and Puducherry have reported their highest single-day jump in cases, with Telangana and Karnataka registering over 1,000 cases on at least one of these days. On Monday, Tamil Nadu reported its highest single-day jump in infections with 3,949 cases. In Karnataka, 1,105 new infections were detected, the second-highest after Sunday’s count of 1,267. Similarly, Telangana reported its highest count of 1,087 new cases on Saturday, while cases jumped by 813 in Andhra Pradesh on Sunday. India’s Covid-19 caseload stood at 5,67,423, as per data collated from state governments. The death toll was 16,882 while the number of recovered patients was over 3.35 lakh. Active cases had risen to over 2.15 lakh. Meanwhile, Maharashtra has recorded over a lakh cases in June so far. With an addition of 5,257 cases on Monday — the fourth consecutive day of adding 5,000-plus cases — the state tally touched 1,69,883. Of the total, 1,02,231 cases were added in June alone, and Mumbai’s share was 37,079, roughly 37%. Maharashtra reported 181 deaths on Monday, taking its toll to 7,610. Officials said 78 of the deaths occurred in the last 48 hours, while 103 were unreported ones from earlier. Mumbai contributed 92 of these deaths, which included 72 unreported deaths. The civic body’s death toll currently stands at 4,462. In Tamil Nadu, fresh Covid-19 infections were close to 4,000 for the second day on Monday, which saw 62 deaths pushing the toll to 1,141. Chennai on Monday recorded 2,167 cases. As the disease spread into the districts, the case doubling time dropped to 14 days for Tamil Nadu from 17 days on June 20, but a bigger worry was the rapidly dropping doubling time for deaths. In June, the state recorded 947 deaths, excluding the 200 deaths in Chennai yet to be added to the official toll. Statistics released by the state health department show that Covid 19 deaths in TN have been doubling in 10-11 days. “We are now beginning to see a spike in deaths in districts. If we don’t contain the disease, it could increase. The only effective way to do this is to increase diagnosis and initiate early treatment,” said former city health officer Dr P Kuganandam. In Gujarat, Ahmedabad recorded an alarming 145% jump in the number of dead cremated at 24 city crematoriums in May this year, as compared to the same month in 2019. The trend has continued in June as 3,380 cremations took place till June 18 this year as compared to 2,523 cremations in the entire month in 2019. The data, shared by the Ahmedabad Municipal Corporation in reply to an Right to Information application, is an indication that loss of lives was much higher this year even if one factors in deaths due to Covid-19 and a maximum 12% rise in deaths expected by AMC year on year. Gujarat in 24 hours ending 5 pm on Monday recorded 626 cases – 13 cases every 30 minutes – the highest for the state so far. The state's tally has now reached 32,023. It's the third consecutive day for the state to post the highest daily tally and 600-plus cases. It’s also the highest daily tally for Surat district that for the first time crossed the 200-cases mark. Delhi’s Covid-19 count crossed the 85,000 mark on Monday with 2,084 more persons testing positive for the disease. The death toll from the disease has touched 2,680, authorities said.

After one full day of silence, this is the response. Twitch isn’t telling the reason either. The only thing that’s certain is the permanent ban and that his Twitch account is gone. Twitch earlier just issued a statement to CNN’s Shannon Liao about the ban which goes like this: ""As is our process, we take appropriate action when we have evidence that a streamer has acted in violation of our Community Guidelines or Terms of Service. These apply to all streamers regardless of status or prominence in the community.” Some have even gone to say that Twitch is acting unfairly towards male gamers because it overlooked indecent behaviour by female streamers and is now not disclosing why Dr Disrespect was banned. But if it was something that was grossly unjust to the streamer, it is strange that he didn’t issue a statement or reach out to his social media handles immediately after the confirmed ban. He has taken a whole day to respond to this and the response too does not shed any light upon the reason behind the ban. Esports journalist Rod Breslau (via Twitter) seems to have some clarity on the conundrum this case is becoming and it is an equally nonplussing one: “look: for several hours now I have been told from credible sources the reason DrDisrespect has been banned. however due to the importance and sensitivity around the subject I have refrained from going on it. i don't feel comfortable with it currently”.

Kavir Mody’s 24 abstract paintings went a long way towards helping an NGO, Shrimad Rajchandra Love and Care (SRLC), further its efforts to help Covid victims and migrants in the city. Kavir, the only son of a Malabar Hill-based businessman, has never taken any art classes—his work is simple, eye-catching, and polished. It was his mother Urvashi who taught him the basics. Kavir is a bibliophile with an eidetic memory, said Urvashi. In the last three months, the Mody family sold his paintings via social media. Urvashi told TOI, “It started when I was making theplas for SRLC’s relief work for migrants. When the migrants left, we decided to contribute to the poor, and I asked Kavir to take up painting.” Looking at the response his first pieces got from friends and family, they realised his art could raise funds for Covid relief work. “At first, we sold the paintings for Rs 6,000. Later, we started getting calls from businessmen, homemakers from Chennai, Bangalore, USA and London, who wanted to see Kavir’s work in their homes and offices,” said Urvashi. The proceeds were donated directly to SRLC. Kavir said that even after his school reopens, he would continue to paint and donate towards the wellbeing of the city’s poor.

The now brimming Kalyani river, which winds its way through a popular pilgrimage site in Barabanki had turned into a trickle, before migrants employed under the flagship MNREGS picked up the spade to breathe life into a parched stretch. On Sunday, while addressing people in his monthly radio programme ‘Mann Ki Baat’, the PM mentioned revival of the Kalyani river. Dug-up silt used to erect bunds along banks of KalyaniYou would be seeing many inspiring stories of migrant labourers. In Uttar Pradesh’s Barabanki, they restored the natural form of Kalyani river after returning home. While staying in isolation, the way migrant labourers changed things around, is commendable, Modi said. The blueprint to revive Kalyani river was hammered out three months ago when the district administration decided to employ 100 workers to dig 3km of a heavilysilted water body from Mawaiyya in Bishunpur tehsil of Barabanki district. Additional commissioner, MNREGS, Yogesh Kumar, said, revival of dry rivers, including Kalyani was taken up in various parts of the state,” he said. The state government had earmarked a budget of Rs 59 lakh under MNREGS for restoration of Kalyani river. The rural development department, while setting a deadline of June 30, was able to generate 30,000 man days by making the river bed 1.5m deep and 25m wide along its course. Later, district officials engaged another 200 migrants. The dug-up silt was used to erect bunds along both its banks, even as the river fed by the monsoon sprung to life and began flowing. The source of the 170km river is Dhannag lake, a pilgrimage centre on Barabanki-Sitapur border. Authorities hope the restoration work will ensure smooth flow of the river, which merges with a Gomti tributary in Ayodhya. A campaign to restore Kalyani was launched in 2013, but it drew the administration’s attention recently, when it planned to provide employment to hundreds of workers who returned home following the pandemic-induced lockdown.

Why do a few infect many?,"At a May 30 birthday party in Texas, one man reportedly infected 18 friends and family with the coronavirus.

Reading reports like these, you might think of the virus as a wildfire, instantly setting off epidemics wherever it goes. But other reports tell another story altogether.

In Italy, for example, scientists looked at stored samples of wastewater for the earliest trace of the virus. Last week they reported that the virus was in Turin and Milan as early as Dec. 18. But two months would pass before northern Italy’s hospitals began filling with victims of COVID-19. So those December viruses seem to have petered out.

As strange as it may seem, these reports don’t contradict each other. Most infected people don’t pass on the coronavirus to someone else. But a small number pass it on to many others in so-called superspreading events.

“You can think about throwing a match at kindling,” said Ben Althouse, principal research scientist at the Institute for Disease Modeling in Bellevue, Washington. “You throw one match, it may not light the kindling. You throw another match, it may not light the kindling. But then one match hits in the right spot, and all of a sudden the fire goes up.”

Understanding why some matches start fires while many do not will be crucial to curbing the pandemic, scientists say. “Otherwise, you’re in the position where you’re always one step behind the virus,” said Adam Kucharski, an epidemiologist at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine.

When the virus first emerged in China, epidemiologists scrambled to understand how it spread from person to person. One of their first tasks was to estimate the average number of people each sick person infected, or what epidemiologists call the reproductive number.

The new coronavirus turned out to have a reproductive number somewhere between two and three. It’s impossible to pin down an exact figure, since people’s behavior can make it easier or harder for the virus to spread. By going into lockdown, for instance, Massachusetts drove its reproductive number down from 2.2 at the beginning of March to 1 by the end of the month; it’s now at 0.74.

This averaged figure can also be misleading because it masks the variability of spread from one person to the next. If 9 out of 10 people don’t pass on a virus at all, while the 10th passes it to 20 people, the average would still be two.

In some diseases, such as influenza and smallpox, a large fraction of infected people pass on the pathogen to a few more. These diseases tend to grow steadily and slowly. “Flu can really plod along,” said Kristin Nelson, an associate professor at Emory University.

But other diseases, like measles and severe acute respiratory syndrome, or SARS, are prone to sudden flares, with only a few infected people spreading the disease.

Epidemiologists capture the difference between the flare-ups and the plodding with something known as the dispersion parameter. It is a measure of how much variation there is from person to person in transmitting a pathogen.

But James Lloyd-Smith, a UCLA disease ecologist who developed the dispersion parameter 15 years ago, cautioned that just because scientists can measure it doesn’t mean they understand why some diseases have more superspreading than others. “We just understand the bits of it,” he said.

When COVID-19 broke out, Kucharski and his colleagues tried to calculate that number by comparing cases in different countries.

If COVID-19 was like the flu, you’d expect the outbreaks in different places to be mostly the same size. But Kucharski and his colleagues found a wide variation. The best way to explain this pattern, they found, was that 10% of infected people were responsible for 80% of new infections. Which meant that most people passed on the virus to few, if any, others.

Kucharski and his colleagues published their study in April as a preprint, a report that has not been reviewed by other scientists and published in a scientific journal. Other epidemiologists have calculated the dispersion parameter with other methods, ending up with similar estimates.

In Georgia, for example, Nelson and her colleagues analyzed over 9,500 COVID-19 cases from March to May. They created a model for the spread of the virus through five counties and estimated how many people each person infected.

In a preprint published last week, the researchers found many superspreading events. Just 2% of people were responsible for 20% of transmissions.

Now researchers are trying to figure out why so few people spread the virus to so many. They’re trying to answer three questions: Who are the superspreaders? When does superspreading take place? And where?

As for the first question, doctors have observed that viruses can multiply to bigger numbers inside some people than others. It’s possible that some people become virus chimneys, blasting out clouds of pathogens with each breath.

Some people also have more opportunity to get sick, and to then make other people sick. A bus driver or a nursing home worker may sit at a hub in the social network, while most people are less likely to come into contact with others — especially in a lockdown.

Nelson suspects the biological differences between people are less significant. “I think the circumstances are a lot more important,” she said. Lloyd-Smith agreed. “I think it’s more centered on the events.”

A lot of transmission seems to happen in a narrow window of time starting a couple days after infection, even before symptoms emerge. If people aren’t around a lot of people during that window, they can’t pass it along.

And certain places seem to lend themselves to superspreading. A busy bar, for example, is full of people talking loudly. Any one of them could spew out viruses without ever coughing. And without good ventilation, the viruses can linger in the air for hours.

A study from Japan this month found clusters of coronavirus cases in health care facilities, nursing homes, day care centers, restaurants, bars, workplaces, and musical events such as live concerts and karaoke parties.

This pattern of superspreading could explain the puzzling lag in Italy between the arrival of the virus and the rise of the epidemic. And geneticists have found a similar lag in other countries: The first viruses to crop up in a given region don’t give rise to the epidemics that come weeks later.

Many countries and states have fought outbreaks with lockdowns, which have managed to draw down COVID-19’s reproductive number. But as governments move toward reopening, they shouldn’t get complacent and forget the virus’ potential for superspreading.

“You can really go from thinking you’ve got things under control to having an out-of-control outbreak in a matter of a week,” Lloyd-Smith said.

Singapore’s health authorities earned praise early on for holding down the epidemic by carefully tracing cases of COVID-19. But they didn’t appreciate that huge dormitories where migrant workers lived were prime spots for superspreading events. Now they are wrestling with a resurgence of the virus.

On the other hand, knowing that COVID-19 is a superspreading pandemic could be a good thing. “It bodes well for control,” Nelson said.

Since most transmission happens only in a small number of similar situations, it may be possible to come up with smart strategies to stop them from happening. It may be possible to avoid crippling, across-the-board lockdowns by targeting the superspreading events.

“By curbing the activities in quite a small proportion of our life, we could actually reduce most of the risk,” Kucharski said.

It has now been six months since the first cases of a mysterious pneumonia-like illness were reported in Wuhan, China.

At the time it was feared that we would see a repeat of the Sars outbreak of 2002 to 2004, which killed 774 people.

The COVID-19 pandemic is not even close to being over, World Health Organization chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus told a briefing on Monday.

 ""We all want this to be over. We all want to get on with our lives. But the hard reality is that this is not even close to being over. Although many countries have made some progress globally, the pandemic is actually speeding up,"" Tedros said. 

He warned, the ""worst is yet to come"" - adding that ""with this kind of environment and conditions, we fear the worst"".

 The global body was planning to convene a meeting this week to assess progress in research towards fighting the disease.

Among those who saw Abdurrahman making headlines in national and international media was Bilal Chawla, a businessman from London. The coolie’s gesture has spurred the businessman to fund his Haj. The busine ssman handed over the cheque to Abdurrahman through the London branch of Karnataka Cultural Foundation (KCF), so the latter could realise the pilgrimage dream by visiting Mecca and Madina. TOI had highlighted the charity of Abdurrahman during the Covid crisis in the end of April. Though Abdurrahman had refused to reveal how much he had saved for the pilgrimage, which costs about Rs 3 lakh, sources said he had handed out provisions costing nearly Rs 1 lakh.  This, he did, after seeing the plight of people, especially the poor and those who were out of jobs due to the pandemic, in his village. Deciding to offer prayers to the Almighty through charity, he distributed rice and other foodgrains to them. His son Elyas Goodinabali told STOI that Chawla got in touch with him after reading about his father’s charity. “Chawla told me that my father’s charity is praiseworthy. Having sponsored the Haj of my father, all he expects in return are prayers for his family. But before he did, religious leader and orator Panakkad Sayyid Munavvar Ali Shihab Thangal had offered to sponsor my father’s Haj. After I shared this info with Chawla, he agreed to sponsor the Haj of my mother. He has given the money through Asif Bajpe, a member of KCF. The cheque has reached my father,” Elyas added.

The absence of early morning wake-up calls (doorbell) from our maids has extended the time we spend sleeping in the morning. Then late night work calls, followed by cooking and OTT binging and the relief of not having to travel to work the next morning has delayed our bedtime by almost an hour or two. And so when we wake up close to our working hours, most of us grab our laptops right after waking up, sit on the bed and start working. Don’t we? A global study had revealed that close to 70 per cent of professionals end up working from bed while they are at home. 

Well, while work from home (WFH) allows us a lot of freedom but to ensure that our WFH habits do not sabotage our work goals as well as our well being, it is important to set boundaries and practice a sense of self control. 


Bed is for sleep
The first and foremost reason you shouldn’t work from bed is that it is not meant for working. Yes, as simple as that. According to the Division of Sleep Medicine at Harvard, one shouldn’t work from the place they sleep in. It is important to keep laptops, TV and work stuff out of the room to ensure you have a healthy mental association between your bedroom and your sleep. So when you work from your bed and then try to sleep there, your mind finds it difficult to associate your bedroom with a place for comfort and sleep. 

So if your brain starts mixing up the place of work and relaxation, it can get tricky for your circadian rhythm. It can give you a feeling of being constantly at work, which shouldn’t be the case. 


Poor posture and screen exposure
You cannot maintain the correct posture while sitting on the bed, which can lead to back aches and discomfort. 

Also, if you work till late from your bedroom, looking at a bright screen can make it difficult for you to sleep. Anyway it is recommended to avoid screen time an hour before you hit the bed. 


So what should you do? 
Create a workspace for yourself. It should be away from your bed. It could be your dining table, or a table in the living area or the study room. But dedicate a separate space for your work.

Last but not least, it may be sounding difficult to get back to a routine but it is all the more essential right now to have a proper wake and sleep cycle. If your mind and body isn’t rested, it cannot perform optimally and can also weaken your immune system.

Though Chinese newspapers and websites continue to be accessible in India, people in China can only access the Indian media websites with Virtual Private Network (VPN) server.  The Indian TV channels also can be accessed through IP TV as of now. And ExpressVPN has not been working in the Communist state for the past two days on the iPhone as well as desktops.  A virtual private network (VPN) is a powerful tool that gives users online privacy and anonymity by creating a private network from a public internet connection. VPNs mask internet protocol (IP) address so a user's online actions are virtually untraceable.  But China has created such a technologically advanced firewall that it blocks even the VPNs.  The recent action comes amid the ongoing tension between India and China after the violent standoff on June 15 in Galwan Valley area in eastern Ladakh in which both sides suffered casualties.  The Chinese action of banning Indian media sites came even before Indian government's move to ban 59 applications including Tik Tok, UC Browser and other Chinese apps ""prejudicial to sovereignty and integrity and defence"" of the country.  China has one of the strongest online censorship in the world. It is known to heavily regulate and censor domestic internet usage and actively block any websites or links that are seen as going against the narrative of the communist party.  The Asian country has the world's most sophisticated censorship system known as the 'Great Firewall'. The Chinese government controls the media through techniques including blocking IP addresses, DNS attacks and filtering specific URLs and keywords within URLs, according to SCMP.  According to an article in South China Morning Post in November, over the years, the number of websites blocked in China has ballooned to 10,000.  The blacklist includes social networks like Facebook, Instagram and WhatsApp; news outlets like Bloomberg, The Wall Street Journal and The New York Times; and popular collaboration tools such as Dropbox and Google Drive (or anything else on Google).

The US announced the decision hours after China said it would curb visas to some Americans heading to Hong Kong, itself a response to a US move.  The United States has been leading a global uproar over a national security law which Hong Kong activists say will destroy the city's freedoms.  ""We can no longer distinguish between the export of controlled items to Hong Kong or to mainland China,"" US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said in a statement.  ""We cannot risk these items falling into the hands of the People's Liberation Army, whose primary purpose is to uphold the dictatorship of the CCP by any means necessary,"" he said, referring to the Chinese Communist Party.  The direct impact will be modest. The State Department last year approved $2.4 million in defense sales to Hong Kong, of which $1.4 million worth were actually sent, including firearms and ammunition for law enforcement, according to official figures.  The Commerce Department simultaneously said it was revoking its special status for Hong Kong.  It will now treat the financial hub the same as China for so-called dual-use exports that have both military and civilian applications -- and which are highly restricted when sought by Beijing.  China promised autonomy for Hong Kong before Britain returned the territory in 1997 but wants no repeat of massive and sometimes destructive protests that rocked the territory last year.  ""It gives us no pleasure to take this action, which is a direct consequence of Beijing's decision to violate its own commitments under the UN-registered Sino-British Joint Declaration,"" Pompeo said.  - Tit-for-tat visa curbs - President Donald Trump's administration has already declared that Hong Kong is no longer autonomous in US eyes and has been rolling out a series of measures in response.  On Friday, the State Department said it was restricting visas for an unspecified number of Chinese officials seen as responsible for infringing on the autonomy of the Asian financial hub.  In response, Chinese foreign ministry spokesman Zhao Lijian said Monday that the US ""scheme... to obstruct the passage of the Hong Kong national security law will never prevail.""  ""To target the US's above wrongful actions, China has decided to impose visa restrictions against American individuals who have behaved egregiously on matters concerning Hong Kong,"" Zhao said.  China's top lawmaking committee passed the law on Tuesday.  While outlawing acts of subversion, secession, terrorism and colluding with foreign forces, the legislation will allow China's security agencies to set up shop publicly in the city for the first time.  Pompeo condemned the move Monday evening.  ""If China wants to regain the trust of Hong Kongers and the international community, it should honor the promises it made to the Hong Kong people,"" he said in a statement.  Britain, the European Union and the United Nations rights watchdog have all voiced fears the law could be used to stifle criticism of Beijing, which uses similar laws on the authoritarian mainland to crush dissent.  In Washington, some US lawmakers fear that Trump will take primarily symbolic action on Hong Kong, preferring to prioritize trade concerns that could affect his re-election campaign.  Last week, the US Senate unanimously approved a bill that would impose mandatory economic sanctions against Chinese officials, Hong Kong police -- and banks that work with them -- if they are identified as hurting the city's autonomous status.  Zhao, the foreign ministry spokesman, warned that the US ""should not review, advance or implement relevant negative bills concerning Hong Kong, even less impose so-called sanctions on China, otherwise China will firmly take strong countermeasures.""  Hong Kong was upended by seven straight months of protests last year, initially sparked by an eventually abandoned plan to allow extraditions to the mainland.  But they soon morphed into a popular revolt against Beijing's rule and widespread calls for democracy. In Video:United States ends sensitive defense exports to Hong Kong; China restricts visas",

Named G4, it is genetically descended from the H1N1 strain that caused a pandemic in 2009. It possesses ""all the essential hallmarks of being highly adapted to infect humans,"" say the authors, scientists at Chinese universities and China's Center for Disease Control and Prevention. From 2011 to 2018, researchers took 30,000 nasal swabs from pigs in slaughterhouses in 10 Chinese provinces and in a veterinary hospital, allowing them to isolate 179 swine flu viruses. The majority were of a new kind which has been dominant among pigs since 2016. The researchers then carried out various experiments including on ferrets, which are widely used in flu studies because they experience similar symptoms to humans — principally fever, coughing and sneezing. G4 was observed to be highly infectious, replicating in human cells and causing more serious symptoms in ferrets than other viruses. Tests also showed that any immunity humans gain from exposure to seasonal flu does not provide protection from G4. According to blood tests which showed up antibodies created by exposure to the virus, 10.4 percent of swine workers had already been infected. The tests showed that as many as 4.4 percent of the general population also appeared to have been exposed. The virus has therefore already passed from animals to humans but there is no evidence yet that it can be passed from human to human — the scientists' main worry. ""It is of concern that human infection of G4 virus will further human adaptation and increase the risk of a human pandemic,"" the researchers wrote. The authors called for urgent measures to monitor people working with pigs. ""The work comes as a salutary reminder that we are constantly at risk of new emergence of zoonotic pathogens and that farmed animals, with which humans have greater contact than with wildlife, may act as the source for important pandemic viruses,"" said James Wood, head of the department of veterinary medicine at Cambridge University. A zoonotic infection is caused by a pathogen that has jumped from a non-human animal into a human. ",

Cable TV, citing an unidentified source, said the law was passed unanimously by the Chinese parliament's top decision-making body. The legislation pushes Beijing further along a collision course with the United States, Britain and other Western governments, which have said it erodes the high degree of autonomy the global financial hub was granted at its July 1, 1997 handover. The United States began eliminating Hong Kong's special status under US law on Monday, halting defence exports and restricting the territory's access to high technology products. Hong Kong leader Carrie Lam, speaking at her regular weekly news conference, said it was not appropriate for her to comment on the legislation as the meeting in Beijing was still ongoing, but threw a jibe at Washington. ""No sort of sanctioning action will ever scare us,"" Lam said. A draft of the law has yet to be published. Beijing says the law, which comes in response to last year's often-violent pro-democracy protests in Hong Kong, aims to tackle subversion, terrorism, separatism and collusion with foreign forces. This month, China's official state agency Xinhua unveiled some of its provisions, including that it would supersede existing Hong Kong legislation and that the power of interpretation belongs to China's parliament top committee. Beijing is expected to set up a national security office in Hong Kong to ""supervise, guide and support"" the city government. Beijing could also exercise jurisdiction on certain cases. Judges for security cases are expected to be appointed by the city's chief executive. Senior judges now allocate rosters up through Hong Kong's independent judicial system. It is still unclear which specific activities are to be made illegal, how precisely they are defined or what punishment they carry. The South China Morning Post (SCMP), quoting an unnamed source, said Xinhua will publish details of the law on Tuesday afternoon and Hong Kong officials will gather at Beijing's top representative office in the city later in the day for a meeting on the legislation. Authorities in Beijing and Hong Kong have repeatedly said the legislation is aimed at a few ""troublemakers"" and will not affect rights and freedoms, nor investor interests. The law comes into force as soon as it is gazetted in Hong Kong, which is seen as imminent. Police have banned this year's July 1 rally on the anniversary of the 1997 handover, citing coronavirus restrictions. It is unclear if attending the rally would constitute a national security crime if the law came into force by Wednesday. The SCMP, citing ""police insiders"", said about 4,000 officers will be on stand by on Wednesday to handle any unrest if people defy the ban. International condemnationHong Kong is one of many developing conflicts between Beijing and Washington, on top of trade issues, the South China Sea and the coronavirus pandemic. Britain has said the security law would violate China's international obligations and its handover agreement, which promised Hong Kong a high degree of autonomy for 50 years under a ""one country, two systems"" formula. Japan's chief cabinet secretary Yoshihide Suga said on Tuesday that if China had passed the security law for Hong Kong, it was ""regrettable"". The European Parliament earlier in June passed a resolution saying the European Union should take China to the International Court of Justice in The Hague if Beijing imposed the law. Foreign ministers of the Group of Seven countries have called on China not to push the legislation. China has hit back at the outcry from the West, denouncing what it called interference in its internal affairs. ",

Trump has refused to wear a mask during visits to states and businesses that require them. Arizona governor Doug Ducey's order went into effect immediately and for at least 30 days. Ducey also ordered public schools to delay the start of classes until at least Aug. 17. Most Arizona bars and nightclubs opened after the governor's stay-at-home and business closure orders were allowed to expire in mid-May. Arizona health officials reported 3,858 more confirmed coronavirus cases Sunday, the most reported in a single day in the state so far and the seventh time in the past 10 days that daily cases surpassed the 3,000 mark.

Kansas governor Laura Kelly said she will issue an executive order mandating the use of masks in stores and shops, restaurants, and in any situation where social distancing of 6 feet (2 meters) cannot be maintained, including outside. The order goes into effect Friday. ""The evidence could not be clearer: Wearing a mask is not only safe, but it is necessary to avoid another shutdown,"" Kelly said. Idaho is moving in a different direction, at least when it comes to the elections. Despite the continuing spread of the virus, state elections officials said Monday that they would allow in-person voting _ as well as mail-in ballots _ for August primaries and the November general election, the Idaho Statesman reported. Idaho's May 19 primary was the first statewide election held by mail only. The primary had record voter turnout. In Texas, a group of bar owners sued on Monday to try to overturn Republican governor Greg Abbott's order closing their businesses. They contend Abbott doesn't have the authority, and they complained that other businesses, such as nail salons and tattoo studios, remain open. ""Governor Abbott continues to act like a king,"" said Jared Woodfill, attorney for the bar owners. ""Abbott is unilaterally destroying our economy and trampling on our constitutional rights."" But Democratic New York governor Andrew Cuomo said that Abbott is on the right path, and he added that Trump should order the wearing of masks. ""States that were recalcitrant ... are doing a 180, and you have the same states now wearing masks,"" Cuomo said. ""Let the president have the same sense to do that as an executive order, and then let the president lead by example and let the president put a mask on it, because we know it works."" One of Cuomo's Republican counterparts, Utah governor Gary Herbert, on a conference call with Vice President Mike Pence and members of the White House coronavirus task force, also asked Pence and Trump to issue a national call to wear masks. Republican Florida governor Ron DeSantis has opposed a statewide mask requirement but said in response to Jacksonville's action that he will support local authorities who are doing what they think is appropriate. In recent weeks, the Republicans moved some of the convention pageantry to Jacksonville after Democratic governor Roy Cooper of North Carolina objected to the holding of a large gathering in Charlotte without social-distancing measures. Less than a week after Jacksonville Mayor Lenny Curry said there would be no mask requirement, city officials announced on Monday that coverings must be worn in ""situations where individuals cannot socially distance."" White House spokeswoman Kayleigh McEnany responded by saying the president's advice is to ""do whatever your local jurisdiction requests of you."" Elsewhere around the world, Britain reimposed lockdown restrictions on the city of Leicester after a spike in cases, ordering the closing of schools along with stores that do not sell essential goods. The European Union is preparing a list of 15 countries whose citizens will be allowed to visit the bloc beginning Wednesday, Spain's foreign minister, Arancha Gonzalez Laya, told the Cadena SER radio network. Because of the resurgence in the U.S., America may not be on that list. ""This is not an exercise to be nice or unfriendly to other countries. This is an exercise of self-responsibility,"" she said.

The United States has been leading global outrage over a proposed security law, which would outlaw subversion and other perceived offenses in Hong Kong, to which Beijing promised autonomy before it was handed back the territory from Britain in 1997. ""It gives us no pleasure to take this action, which is a direct consequence of Beijing's decision to violate its own commitments under the UN-registered Sino-British Joint Declaration,"" Pompeo said.

Organisations around the world are racing to find ways to treat and prevent the deadly pathogen, which first emerged in the central Chinese city of Wuhan and has since killed over half a million people worldwide. More than half of 17 candidate vaccines identified by the World Health Organization (WHO) that are in clinical evaluation involve Chinese companies or institutes. Hong Kong-listed CanSino Biologics said in a filing to the stock exchange that data from clinical trials showed the Chinese military vaccine had a ""good safety profile"" and potential to prevent disease caused by the novel coronavirus. CanSino said Monday that China's Central Military Commission approved the use of the vaccine on June 25, for one year. The vaccine was jointly developed by CanSino and the Beijing Institute of Biotechnology, part of the Academy of Military Medical Sciences. Its use cannot be expanded without further approvals, the listing said. It was not clear how widely it would be used within China's enormous military forces, and the ministry of defence did not reply to an AFP request for further information. CanSino added that it cannot guarantee the vaccine -- which had its phase one and two clinical trials done in China -- will ultimately be commercialised. Another 131 candidate vaccines listed by the WHO are in the pre-clinical phase. None have yet been approved for commercial use against the coronavirus. According to medical journal The Lancet there have already been more than 1,000 clinical trials on dozens of pharmaceutical treatments for the virus but no totally effective medical intervention has been found.

Now some of those fears are being realized. In southern Yemen, health workers are leaving their posts en masse because of a lack of protective equipment, and some hospitals are turning away patients struggling to breathe. In Sudan's war-ravaged Darfur region, where there is little testing capacity, a mysterious illness resembling Covid-19 is spreading through camps for the internally displaced. Coronavirus pandemic: Complete CoverageIt's time to mask up and stay safe: Join TOI's #MaskIndia campaignMHA's guidelines for home isolationTrust the newspaper for your daily verified newsCases are soaring in India and Pakistan, together home to more than 1.5 billion people and where authorities say nationwide lockdowns are no longer an option because of high poverty. In Latin America, Brazil has a confirmed caseload and death count second only to the United States, and its leader is unwilling to take steps to stem the spread of the virus. Alarming escalations are unfolding in Peru, Chile, Ecuador and Panama, even after they imposed early lockdowns. The first reports of disarray are also emerging from hospitals in South Africa, which has its continent's most developed economy. Sick patients are lying on beds in corridors as one hospital runs out of space. At another, an emergency morgue was needed to hold more than 700 bodies. ""We are reaping the whirlwind now,"" said Francois Venter, a South African health expert at the University of Witswatersrand in Johannesburg. Worldwide, there are 10.1 million confirmed cases and over 501,000 reported deaths, according to a tally by Johns Hopkins University of government reports. Experts say both those numbers are serious undercounts of the true toll of the pandemic, due to limited testing and missed mild cases. South Africa has more than a third of Africa's confirmed cases of Covid-19 with 138,000 as of Monday. It's ahead of other African countries in the pandemic timeline and approaching its peak. So far its facilities have managed to cope, but if they become overwhelmed, it will be a grim forewarning because South Africa's health system is reputed to be the continent's best. Most poor countries took action early on. Some, like Uganda, which already had a sophisticated detection system built up during its yearslong battle with viral hemorrhagic fever, have thus far been arguably more successful than the US and other wealthy countries in battling coronavirus. But since the beginning of the pandemic, poor and conflict-ravaged countries have been at a major disadvantage, and they remain so. The global scramble for protective equipment sent prices soaring. Testing kits have also been hard to come by. Tracking and quarantining patients requires large numbers of health workers. ""It's all a domino effect,"" said Kate White, head of emergencies for Doctors Without Borders. ""Whenever you have countries that are economically not as well off as others, then they will be adversely affected."" Global health experts say testing is key, but months into the pandemic, few developing countries can keep carrying out the tens of thousands of tests every week needed to detect and contain outbreaks. ""The majority of the places that we work in are not able to have that level of testing capacity, and that's the level that you need to be able to get things really under control,"" White said. South Africa leads Africa in testing, but an initially promising program has now been overrun in Cape Town, which alone has more reported cases than any other African country except Egypt. Critical shortages of kits have forced city officials to abandon testing for anyone under 55 unless they have a serious health condition or are in a hospital. Venter said Cape Town's hospitals are managing to cope ``by the skin of their teeth'' and now Johannesburg, South Africa's biggest city, is experiencing a surge of infections. He said South Africa's rising cases could easily play out next in ``the big cities of Nigeria, Congo, Kenya,'' and they ``do not have the health resources that we do.'' Lockdowns are likely the most effective safeguard, but they have exacted a heavy toll even on middle-class families in Europe and North America, and are economically devastating in developing countries. India's lockdown, the world's largest, caused countless migrant workers in major cities to lose their jobs overnight. Fearing hunger, tens of thousands took to the highways by foot to return to their home villages, and many were killed in traffic accidents or died from dehydration. The government has since set up quarantine facilities and now provides special rail service to get people home safely, but there are concerns the migration has spread the virus to India's rural areas, where the health infrastructure is even weaker. Poverty has also accelerated the pandemic in Latin America, where millions with informal jobs had to go out and keep working, and then returned to crowded homes where they spread the virus to relatives. Peru's strict three-month lockdown failed to contain its outbreak, and it now has the world's sixth-highest number of cases in a population of 32 million, according to Johns Hopkins. Intensive care units are nearly 88% occupied and the virus shows no sign of slowing. ``Hospitals are on the verge of collapse,'' said epidemiologist Ciro Maguina, a professor of medicine at Cayetano Heredia University in the capital, Lima. Aid groups have tried to help, but they have faced their own struggles. Doctors Without Borders says the price it pays for masks went up threefold at one point and is still higher than normal. The group also faces obstacles in transporting medical supplies to remote areas as international and domestic flights have been drastically reduced. And as wealthy donor countries struggle with their own outbreaks, there are concerns they will cut back on humanitarian aid. Mired in civil war for the past five years, Yemen was already home to the world's worst humanitarian crisis before the virus hit. Now the Houthi rebels are suppressing all information about an outbreak in the north, and the health system in the government-controlled south is collapsing. ``Coronavirus has invaded our homes, our cities, our countryside,'' said Dr. Abdul Rahman al-Azraqi, an internal medicine specialist and former hospital director in the city of Taiz, which is split between the rival forces. He estimates that 90% of Yemeni patients die at home. ``Our hospital doesn't have any doctors, only a few nurses and administrators. There is effectively no medical treatment.'' ",

Completing these works would have taken two years during normal times, railway board chairman V K Yadav said, since getting long-duration track blockages are difficult. The works included rebuilding and rehabilitation of 82 bridges, 48 limited height subways and road under bridge in lieu of level crossing gates, construction and strengthening of 16 foot over bridges (FOBs), dismantling of 14 old FOBs and remodeling of five yards. Yadav said some of these pending works created bottlenecks for railways and their completion would help increased speed of trains on such sections. An official release said, “Indian Railways focused on several long pending overdue maintenance works which required traffic block of long durations…They were planned during lockdown period considering it ‘once in a lifetime opportunity’ to wipe out these maintenance arrears and take up the execution of work without affecting the train service.” Railways completed two projects of doubling with electrification in Varanasi division. These projects resulted in decongestion of east-west routes and facilitation of freight movement. ",

Answer - Ya, unfortunately (laughs). That's how this conversation began, which moved like a drive cutting through the roads in the hills -- touching the peaks when 'success' was the subject and hitting the depths of a valley at the mention of 'disappointment'. But never did Vijay Bharadwaj, who proudly calls himself a ""failed cricketer"", let it affect the spirit in his voice. The summary of Vijay's recollection of his international career, lasting just three Tests and 10 ODIs, can easily be found in Oscar Wilde's famous words: ""Success is a science; if you have the conditions, you get the result."" Vijay's career is a reflection of that, but only in the context of his limited days in international cricket, when 'conditions' failed to support his endeavour. The Karnataka cricketer, coach and commentator would stop anyone trying to paint his cricket life based only on those 13 games in India colours. ""I was not new to the scene,"" Bharadwaj began by introducing himself, especially to any 21st-century cricket fan who looked back at him and what he achieved like a flash in the pan. ""I came into the Ranji Trophy team in 1993-94. That's when we had the best of the teams in the country, with legends like Anil Kumble and Rahul Dravid, Javagal Srinath, Venkatesh Prasad, Sunil Joshi -- six or seven legendary cricketers."" The sweat Vijay broke in the 1990s to get into the Indian team could be felt in his voice and also in the credentials he put together in bullet points. ""From '93 to '99, ít was the best period for our state, and I was one of the highest run-getters for Karnataka, almost all the time when we won the Ranji Trophy. We won three Ranji Trophy titles in the period. To play one final is in itself a big thing, but to play three Ranji Trophy finals and to get three hundreds in Ranji Trophy finals is nothing short of some achievement, I guess."" Bharadwaj told TimesofIndia.com. He rounded off that introduction with the mention of his first-class record for Karnataka that still stands. ""1280 runs in a season for Karnataka. That's how I got into the Indian team."" THE PEAKIn 1999, the bespectacled Bharadwaj started plying his trade for India as a batting allrounder who could bowl more than useful off-spin. He was the seventh man from Karnataka to make the national cut in that prolific era for the state. Bharadwaj turned out to be the trump card for India in his debut series -- the four-nation LG Cup in Nairobi in 1999. India lost the final to South Africa, but Bharadwaj caught everyone's attention with his 10 wickets and 89 runs in four ODIs. It won him the 'Man of the Series' award. The perfect example of a 'dream start'. ""The transition and the gap was too huge. You are straight away playing in front of a crowd of one lakh or billions of eyeballs on TV. How do you handle that pressure? You need to be a little lucky to get the kind of break that I had. I was really high on confidence because I trusted my batting,"" the 44-year-old recalled. Bharadwaj's next appointment was against New Zealand at home, and his limited overs numbers kept improving, especially in bowling. ""There also, in the one-day series, I was the highest wicket-taker. Nobody even knows that."" THE LOWSHis Test debut was on home tracks, where he had been consistently scoring well in Ranji Trophy. It was time to do the same, but on a different, bigger stage. The occasion, perhaps, got the better of the youngster. ""I played only one Test match (during that series against the Kiwis). In my debut game, I got out first ball, without even realising what Test cricket is. A golden duck. I was dropped for the third Test,"" he recalled. The next assignment was Australia -- a tour that defines the character of any cricketer. If the on-field sledging tests the thickness of your skin, the heckling at the boundary ropes can easily get on your nerves. Even Virat Kohli found himself at the receiving end of it in Sydney, which led to his infamous finger salute. ""We travelled to Australia, one of the toughest tours. I had never ever seen an Australian pitch before that. I sat (out) for two Test matches. Everybody was failing. Rahul's series average was somewhere around 15 or 20. Imagine someone who had played 5-6 years of Indian cricket was failing. (Sourav) Ganguly was a failure as well in that series, never got (many) runs. VVS Laxman didn't score, no opener could score."" ""I went in at No. 6 or No. 7. Imagine the morale of the team. Sachin (Tendulkar) was devastated because he was performing as a batsman, but as a captain he was not able to understand what was happening. So what would happen to a youngster like me when some of the seniors were failing like that. They had no clue what was happening. We lost 3-0."" ""During the Sydney Test that I played, my back got injured badly. For the next one and a half years, I didn't get up because I was bedridden; and nobody even bothered to ask me what was happening. I was totally lost."" Bharadwaj recalled, while speaking to TimesofIndia.com. AN EYE OPERATION GONE WRONGIn a talent pool as vast as you find in India, an year's absence from the scene could easily mean you are a thing of the past. Bharadwaj's case was nothing different and it got worse with ill-fated advice. ""I used to wear spectacles. So in 2000 (while recovering from the back injury), someone suggested to get the eyes operated (to get rid of the glasses). I did that and lost my eyes as well. My vision went for a toss. After that, I was not the same cricketer anymore,"" he recalled. ""When I ultimately got my eyes tested, it was gone, in the sense that I could not even follow the path of the ball while fielding, forget about batting."" 'MENTALLY WRECKED'A first-ball run-out against Zimbabwe in 2002 and an average India A tour to England the following year meant Bhardawaj went off the selectors' and team's radar, not just for India but also in domestic cricket for Karnataka. The vision was just not the same as before. ""I got selected for India A, but I had lost my (best) vision then. I didn't have the guts to go and tell them 'don't select me'. As a youngster, you can't go and tell people that you can't see the ball, because you are mentally wrecked. You just go there and try it out."" Bharadwaj made a move to Jharkhand in 2005, but at the back of his mind he knew it was game over. 'NOBODY THERE TO HELP YOU OUT'It's fair to assess that the double blow, first the back injury and then vision loss, in the same year pushed Bharadwaj towards the depths of depression. That is still a reality of sports, with current players like Glenn Maxwell admitting the same thanks to the relentless pressure to perform and endless travel. But was there a way that Bharadwaj could have sought help, maybe discuss it with seniors? The answer he gave was a straight 'No', and he had his reasons for it. ""No way you could have done that,"" he said. ""That was not an option at all. You couldn't have gone and spoken to your seniors or a selector, saying that 'I am not mentally okay'. You will have to find your own way. That's how it was. Maybe things have changed now, maybe the board is also open to it now, but those days were something different."" ""It was not the fear of getting dropped, it was the fear of your career ending...I was totally a mental-wreck because I knew I could not play further. I was almost on the verge of breaking down. But in our country, the system says you don't go and tell someone that you're suffering."" ""The reason why I'm saying this is that in our country, the stigma is much bigger. If you go and tell someone that I'm suffering, I'm not in the right state of mind, then they will think there's something wrong with this guy; and that propaganda goes in a negative way. So you hide, don't tell anyone."" ""Nobody even thought from my point of view. Should I go and tell my parents? Should I go and tell my friends or teammates? Nobody will be there to help you out. That's how it is. "" Bharadwaj told TimesofIndia.com. ""They will brand you, saying your temperament is not right, you are not fit enough. That's how it is. So not only yourself, you'll have to fight the system, you're fighting both. How difficult it is - can anybody imagine that?"" ""You are lonely, but you will have to fight your own battle. You can't blame someone else."" Trying to further explain, Bhardawaj spoke about an incident on the tour of Australia. ""Just to give an example, if Shane Warne comes and says 'I need baked beans and spaghetti', they say it's professionalism. But as a vegetarian, if I go and ask, 'I need something (vegetarian) to eat', they say 'you are a cribber'. That's the response I got, 'you are a cribber, you crib all the time'. How can there be one rule for Shane Warne and a different one for me?"" 'IT IS OKAY TO FAIL'Bharadwaj, who went on to create a space for himself by becoming a Level 3 BCCI coach, wants to take the onus on himself rather than get involved in a blame game. However, he does drop a hint that he could have been a different cricketer had luck and circumstances presented him with more chances. ""Now, if I look back, I cannot blame the system. It's up to us. People have survived. Rahul Dravid, Laxman made comebacks, otherwise Dravid would have been lost for the entire cricketing world. I didn't have that kind of luck. ""I cannot blame anybody, I need to blame myself. But with that blame, I'm not regretting at all. The whole idea is to tell the youngsters that it's okay to fail. It's not a crime to fail, just go out there and try it out. Even if people criticise you, that's okay. Nothing will happen,"" he said as a message to those who feel disappointed with failure. ""If you see my Twitter account, my bio says 'failed cricketer'. I don't have any regrets in that."" After coaching stints with the Karnataka Ranji Trophy team, Royal Challengers Bangalore in the Indian Premier League and the Oman national team, Bharadwaj found his niche as an ex-cricketer, in the commentary box. However, he wants to stick to doing commentary only in his mother tongue, Kannada. ""Now I am very clear that if I don't do commentary, I would not do anything with the game."" ",Jaspreet Sahni

Pawan Munjal, chairman and CEO of Hero Moto-Corp, said the company has gradually resumed production at its factories in India, Bangladesh and Colombia (in Latin America), though the output is limited to begin with. However, he said that while the company conserves cash, it will not be cutting jobs or salaries. “The plants are not fully functional as yet, as we are working in single shift, with a smaller number of people. We are not operating all assembly lines, and are maintaining a safe distance. This naturally brings down our production and productivity,” Munjal said at the opening session of TOI Dialogues, a unique leadership summit (The topic for Tuesday’s TOI Dialogues was business continuity in the times of Covid). 04:43Top 10 Dialogues of Dr. Pawan Munjal at TOI Dialogues inaugural sessionHero MotoCorp had said a few months ago that the company was looking to invest as much as Rs 10,000 crore towards model launches, new technologies, and capacity augmentation. Munjal said that some of these investments may now be deferred. “We are paying salaries, and taking care of our overheads in a shutdown when we are not making any revenues. The most important thing for the organisation now is to conserve cash. Cash is very precious, and so investments do take a back seat.” Munjal said that investments that were already in progress would be completed. “… we haven’t stopped that. But where we did not start, we definitely stopped… We will definitely defer expansion in Halol (Gujarat) plant and new investments in Andhra Pradesh facility.” The company does not see the need to produce more when demand is expected to stay weak. “For this fiscal, the total sales will probably be lower than what we had expected previously. Thus, why would we go there and put in investments that will stand still and give no returns?” Apart from a cut in GST, Munjal said that the government should also look at reducing dividend tax. “People will then have the ability to give higher dividends and put more money in the hands of the consumers.” Watch the complete session of TOI Dialogues",Pankaj Doval

The crisis is “much worse from an economic impact” point of view compared to what the industry had suffered during the global financial meltdown of 2008-09. Also, on-site personnel deployment outside India will come down and software teams will increasingly work out of India, Tech Mahindra MD & CEO C P Gurnani said. “There will clearly be a slowdown. The question is how long and how much? The slowdown is inevitable,” Gurnani told TOI Dialogues in a special series on the Indian IT industry and the impact of the coronavirus. 19:56Top 10 Dialogues of CP Gurnani at TOI Dialogues: Rise of Digital EconomyThe Tech Mahindra boss said, “There will be a lag, and that lag will hit the economy. My belief is that it is already hurting us... So, there will be a drop in the revenues.” Tech Mahindra has over 1.2 lakh employees and gets a large part of its business from markets across Europe and the US, apart from India. Gurnani said that while the focus on network and services, and media and entertainment will keep the situation under control for Tech Mahindra, there are other areas where companies may find the going tough for a few quarters. “I don’t want to be negative, but everyone knows that the businesses are impacted. If a motorcycle manufacturer is not manufacturing motorcycles, he is not going to give me a new transformation project. If you do not fly, clearly the airline industry is not going to give me a new project. So, it is clear that there will be a slowdown.” Gurnani said that there will be two quarters of stress if the second wave (of the pandemic) is not very strong. “Of course, all of us will live in suspense till a vaccine is discovered. My best estimate at this stage is that October onwards, there will be a recovery in Indian IT and the global IT spends.” Speaking about cyber security, Gurnani said that there is a need to be vigilant against fraudsters, hackers and online criminals. “I don’t think we take cyber security seriously enough. My personal belief is that the next wave of panic can only come through cyber security lapses and all of us need to be prepared for it.” Asked whether India is under-prepared in terms of cyber security, he said, “… if you choose not to be prepared, and take it lightly, then it is a serious threat. Your risk management policy should prepare you for that highest risk.” ",Pankaj Doval

The research led by professor Urbasi Sinha and her team, in collaboration with professor Barry Sanders from the University of Calgary, Canada is a part of the Quantum Experiments using Satellite Technology (QuEST) project, India’s first satellite-based secure quantum communication effort, supported by the Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO). The toolkit offers exhaustive inclusion of different experimental imperfections, both device-based as well as process-based. Thus their simulation results will match with actual experimental implementations to much better accuracy than any other existing toolkit, making it a QKD experimenter’s best friend. As QKD is growing rapidly in academic, industrial, government, and defence laboratories, this newly developed simulation toolkit, accompanied by an instructive application to the uniquely designed B92 experiment, will be extremely influential, as per a statement. The B92 is a QKD protocol, which uses single photons and associated laws of Physics like the Uncertainty Principle and the No-Cloning theorem to assure perfect security. “Secure error free communication protocols are assuming extraordinary importance for which Quantum key distribution (QKD) is an attractive solution, which relies on a cryptographic protocol. A shared random secret key known only to the communicating parties is employed to encrypt and decrypt messages. A unique property of quantum key distribution is that any break in attempt by an unauthorized party is immediately detected. This is because any process of measuring a quantum system creates detectable anomalies,” said Prof Ashutosh Sharma, Secretary, DST. The research work is two-fold in its novelty as well as process development. On the one hand, they have developed a simulation toolkit, which bridges a significant gap in the QKD community. On the other hand, they have performed a novel implementation of what is called a prepare and measure QKD protocol (B92), which has higher key rates and lower quantum bit error rate than earlier reported works following similar source methodology.

The trailer begins with an excerpt from T.S. Eliot’s ‘The Love Song of J. Alfred Prufrock’ that reads, “...There will be time to prepare a face to meet the faces that you meet.”

It is this line that sets the tone for this trailer that follows two ladies and a fateful meeting at a bus stop that will forever alter their perspective of the world around them. 

 


Without letting us in on who these women are or their backgrounds, it is established in the opening shots that one of the two ladies is more rooted in her cultural identity and chooses to wear a burqua and accepts the unwelcoming glances that come her way. Her will is shaken, when two young boys squirt her with water guns. Things only get worse, when people plying the same bus, give off warning glances.

While one’s motives to wear the piece of clothing is dithered the other woman, who chooses to maintain her own identity, begins to question the incident and possibly even sees her cultural heritage in a new light.

According to reports, the film is set in London and talks on the subject of prejudice, stereotyping of cultures and the fleeting moments of loneliness and hurt triggered by otherwise unalarming events. Will they hold on their roots or will their desire to blend into a sceptical society tip the scales in this very personal conflict?

Considering the topic of growing biases, racism and intolerance is extremely relevant right now the trailer of The Disguise couldn’t have come at a better time. 

Produced by Riya Mukherjee and directed by Varma, the short film stars Naomi Willow, Adriana Grigoriev, Zed Josef and Jennifer Scott Malden in lead roles.

The IT ministry said the apps listed, including ByteDance’s TikTok, WeChat, and others owned by Tencent, Alibaba, Baidu and Xiaomi ""engaged in activities prejudicial to sovereignty and integrity of India, defence of India, security of state and public order."" The move comes in the backdrop of current stand-off along the Line of Actual control (LAC) in Ladakh with Chinese troops. This marks the largest sweep against the Chinese technology companies. What it means for Chinese tech firmsThe ban significantly narrows a top growth market for Chinese technology firms and may embolden other governments to shut them out. For Beijing-based ByteDance, India has been the biggest driver of TikTok installs, accounting for 611 million downloads, or 30% of the total, according to SensorTower. Cutting off new users, and existing ones as they try to install updates, will sting its mooted valuation of $110 billion. China says concerned about India banning appsThe company faces a similar backlash in the United States where lawmakers are also suspicious about Beijing’s access to consumer data. Slippery road ahead for startups?The blacklist excludes the country’s most valuable startups, including the $16 billion payments giant Paytm, backed by Ant Financial, as well as education star Byju’s, which counts Tencent as an investor. In total, 18 of India’s 30 unicorns have Chinese funding, Gateway House, a Mumbai-based think-tank reckons. But new investment rules and rising anti-China sentiment may slow the overall flow of capital from the People’s Republic and that will hurt growth. Curbs on Chinese imports to hit mfg ops: Auto cosWill banning apps be easy?Digital and technology experts say that it will be difficult to execute the ban on 59 Chinese apps as it would require internet service providers to blacklist every host name and domain name associated with these apps. It would also require Google and Apple to remove these apps from their stores, which could expose users to unofficial versions of the apps. Difficult to execute ban on Chinese apps: Digital expertsExperts explained that technology companies upload the official version of their apps on the App Store (Apple) and Play Store (Google), but even when applications are taken down from these platforms, users can still download their unofficial versions from the web.

Donald Trump’s order last week halts approvals of a range of visas through year-end, including those for intra-company transfers and study-abroad programs, and is aimed at giving Americans preference after record job losses from the coronavirus pandemic. Key for the tech industry are H-1B visas used by workers from India and other countries to fill key roles. Visa processing is an elaborate, months-long affair so any disruption could hurt the ability of critical workers to travel to clients sites for an extended period. Already, the virus lockdowns have blocked consulate visits essential to the process and forced hundreds of thousands of workers into challenging work-from-home situations. India’s technology trade group, Nasscom, called Trump’s order “misguided and harmful to the US economy” and warned it would exacerbate the country’s economic pain. Indian companies provide technology staff and services to US hospitals, drugmakers and biotechnology companies, Nasscom pointed out. In addition, the industry may send more workers to Canada or Mexico without access to the US market. “These are highly-skilled workers who are in great demand and they will be mobile no matter what,” said Shivendra Singh, president of global trade development at Nasscom. Among the other critics of the order were Alphabet Inc chief executive officer Sundar Pichai, Microsoft Corp president Brad Smith and Tesla Inc founder Elon Musk. Pichai, himself a beneficiary of the H-1B visa system in the 1990s, tweeted, “Immigration has contributed immensely to America’s economic success making it a global leader in tech, and also Google the company it is today.” Immigration has contributed immensely to America’s economic success, making it a global leader in tech, and also Go… https://t.co/dnE6h9JG8U— Sundar Pichai (@sundarpichai) 1592864457000Tata Consultancy Services Ltd, Infosys Ltd and Wipro Ltd, among the largest outsourcing companies in Asia, declined to comment. India accounts for about 70% of the 85,000 H-1B visas issued annually, according to immigration data. Of this total, 65,000 visas are issued to foreign talent with bachelor’s degrees, while the remaining 20,000 can be allotted to workers who have more advanced degrees. The visa system was conceived so companies could hire overseas workers to fill a shortage of high-skilled talent in technology services and product development. The fact that Indian outsourcers collect a substantial share of the visas each year has made the program controversial, with critics arguing that companies abuse the system by replacing American workers with cheaper foreign labor. Soon after taking office, Trump vowed he would crack down on work visas and reform the “broken” immigration system. One longer-term concern for outsourcers is the administration’s planned revamp of the current H-1B visa program, which would replace the current lottery system for determining who gets visas with a merit-based system that prioritizes applicants based on wages. That would mean more workers with high salaries would likely receive visas. Now, outsourcing companies are dealing with the unpredictability of the visa situation and the prospect that an H-1B revamp could make it difficult to send anyone but the most critical of talent overseas. The most recent visa curbs could hammer outsourcers’ current model of talent deployment. Companies are beginning to question whether so much onsite travel is necessary, and some are ramping up local hiring or local subcontractors. The pandemic has prompted companies to look at worker clusters away from client sites but close enough to collaborate on projects. For instance, if a company has 20,000 employees spread across 40 cities, these could be aggregated in a few clusters and if the visa restrictions continue, the clusters may not be in Texas or New Jersey but in Canada or Mexico. “Offshoring could increase because, for clients, the virus lockdowns have already driven home the merits of remote working,” said Singh, speaking over the phone from New Delhi. Indian companies could see an impact on their margins because of increased worker salaries, higher costs of local hiring and subcontracting and the collateral damage from visa rejections and prolonged processing times. “The temporary suspension of H-1B visa programme till December 2020 will hamper execution of pipeline and new projects coupled with margin impact resulting from higher onshore hiring,” credit rating company ICRA said in a note last week.

The report - Towards a Clean Energy Economy: Post-COVID-19 Opportunities in India's Energy and Mobility Sectors - is prepared by government think tank Niti Aayog and Rocky Mountain Institute. It also said there may be delays in electric vehicles (EV) production as manufacturers focus on reviving demand and producing BS-VI vehicles, while curbs on imports of Chinese components may lead to disruptions in EV manufacturing. ""Auto sales could decrease by as much as 45 per cent in the financial year 2020–21. EV production could be affected in the short term due to lower demand and supply-chain disruptions with BNEF estimating an 18 per cent decrease in global EV sales in 2020. ""The EV market may experience other shifts. For example, there is an expectation of demand for more affordable EV products. This potential shift in consumer preferences may affect manufacturers' investment and production decisions. Ultimately, resuming production levels for conventional vehicles and EVs will depend on demand revival, supply-chain reactivation, and access to the labour force,"" the report said. Lower disposable incomes and a tendency towards cash saving will lead to reduced demand for EV in the short term, the report said, adding ""some OEMs' customers are pushing back their EV business plans by two or more years"". On the impact on EV supply chains, the report said, ""There may be delays in EV production as manufacturers focus on reviving demand and producing BS-VI vehicles. Curbs on imports of Chinese components may lead to disruptions in EV manufacturing"". The report also highlighted the consequences of policy changes stating ""many state EV policies and e-bus projects may be delayed due to other priorities and social-distancing challenges"". Stressing that the emerging situation and challenges in the context of COVID-19 has and will continue to disrupt business as usual in the mobility sector, the report said the impact of the pandemic on passenger and freight segments, as well as the auto industry, raise several questions. These include whether the overall demand for mobility will fall in the short to medium-term, will ridership of public and shared transport modes decline and will private modes be preferred? It also pondered whether lack of auto sales will cause a severe hit to the supply chain and a growing call for self-sufficiency lead to a push to create local supply chains. ""Will the Prime Minister's call for domestic manufacturing and localisation attract investments at a time when a recession is looming? Would the new mobility ecosystem propelled by startups be able to survive the crisis,"" it wondered. ",

The ACC feature will provide motorcyclists with a completely new and comfortable riding experience. The Active Cruise Control feature comes with distance control for maximum comfort and best possible safety while riding a motorcycle. BMW Motorrad developed the new ACC feature in cooperation with Bosch. The many years of experience with passenger car driver assistance systems of both companies could be applied selectively here and used for motorcycle applications. The ACC feature is apt for demanding touring motorcyclists. The system automatically regulates the vehicle speed when the distance to the vehicle in front is reduced and keeps the distance defined by the rider. This distance can be varied in three stages. Both the riding speed as well as the distance to the vehicle in front can be set conveniently using a button. The distance control can also be deactivated in order to be able to use the Dynamic Cruise Control (DCC). When cornering, the speed is automatically reduced by the ACC if required and a comfortable lean angle is aimed at. With an increasing lean angle, however, the braking and acceleration dynamics are limited in order to maintain a stable rideability and not to unsettle the rider by abrupt braking or acceleration. ",

India are set to tour Australia for a four-match Test series, starting December 3 at Gabba, Brisbane. During the series all eyes would be on Rohit, who had scored three hundreds including a double ton against South Africa at home in his debut series as Test opener last October. He, however, missed two games in New Zealand due to a calf injury. ""It's going to test any batsman in the world, but I think because he's (Rohit) played a lot of One-Day cricket batting at the top of the order, and now he's been having some success with the red ball game as well, that'll give him confidence coming in,"" Hussey said. ""I have no doubt in my mind that he's got the ability and the skill and the temperament, to be able to handle it."" The former Australia left-handed batsman said the key for Rohit would be adaptability to the Australian conditions. ""I think he would adapt. No, worries at all of his batting at the top of the order. It will be challenging in Australian conditions against the top quality bowling attack with pace and bounce,"" Hussey said. The 45-year-old left-handed batsman feels that the return of the disgraced duo of Steve Smith and David Warner will make life difficult for the Indians in the upcoming series. Smith and Warner missed India's historic away Test series win over Australia in 2018 because of their one-year bans for their involvement in the infamous ball-tampering episode in South Africa. In the absence of the duo, India recorded their first Test series win Down Under in 2018-19. ""Obviously, bringing back Smith and Warner into the team is huge, but the guys that were exposed and perhaps probably weren't quite ready at the time from two years ago, have now managed to get a number of Test matches under their belt... India are going to be up for a stiff challenge in Australia this summer,"" Hussey said in a chat show on Sony Ten's Pit Stop. ""Put that with a world class bowling attack in Pat Cummins, Mitchell Starc, Josh Hazelwood and (James) Pattinson as well with Nathan Lyon...I think the team looks extremely strong, they are playing some excellent Test cricket. We know India are a world class team, but they have to be at their best to beat the Australian team on home soil."" Hussey feels the absence of the two key batsmen, Smith and Warner, exposed the young Australians to the rigours of Test cricket. ""They basically had to either sink or swim and someone like (Travis) Head I think has really shown a lot of character, a lot of guts and a lot of fight in grabbing hold of his opportunity and he's performed pretty well,"" he said. Post the sandpaper gate scandal, Hussey feels the Australian team has worked extremely hard to gain their respect back. ""The team copped up a lot of stick, lost a lot of respect in the cricket community here in Australia and all around the world. They've worked extremely hard over the last couple of years to gain the respect back from the cricket community, by the way they play and the way they conduct themselves and I think Tim Paine's led that really well,"" he said. The Chennai Super Kings-player-turned-batting consultant further hailed 'Captain Cool' Mahendra Singh Dhoni, saying he should be allowed to take a call on his career. ""He's been an incredible person and player for CSK for so long, and India for that matter, and we hope he keeps playing for another 10 years but I'm not sure we're going to be able to see that so hopefully he can play for as long as he can."" Post India's World Cup semifinal exit in 2019, Dhoni has been on a sabbatical with speculation surrounding his career. Hussey also admired the way Virat Kohli respects the presence of Dhoni in the team and the chemistry the duo shares. ""I think you got to give a lot of kudos to Virat Kohli, having someone like MS Dhoni still in the team who's been, arguably, India's most successful captain. Sometimes some people would find that threatening to still have that person in the team,"" he said. ""But I think that's where you need to tip your hat to Virat and so you know he's obviously got the personality to say 'no, no I would like this guy around.

Having never led a side in first-class cricket, star all-rounder Stokes will be captaining the national team for the first time in his career when England and West Indies lock horns in the opening Test of the three-match series at the Ageas Bowl in Southampton from July 8. Root's wife, Carrie, is due to give birth later this week. ""Durham all-rounder Ben Stokes, who has been Root's Test vice-captain since his appointment last July, will captain the side for the first time in Southampton,"" the England and Wales Cricket Board (ECB) said in a release. Jos Buttler, who serves as vice-captain to Eoin Morgan in the limited-overs side and has also been Root's deputy in the past, will assume vice-captaincy duties in the opener, the ECB added. The country's cricket board also added that Root will have to self-isolate for seven days at home once he leaves hospital with his family. ""Root will commence a seven-day self-isolation period at home once he leaves hospital with his family. He will join up with the England squad ahead of the second Test at Emirates Old Trafford on Monday 13 July,"" the ECB stated. The mainstay is expected to be available for the second Test, which starts on July 16. Stokes could thus become England's least-experienced captain in their history, never having captained a first-class, List A or T20 game. Stokes had earlier said that he won't change his playing approach even if he is handed England's captaincy in the absence of regular skipper Root for the series-opener against the West Indies. ""I hope that I always try to set the example in terms of attitude and commitment If I am in charge that's not going to change the way that I go about things,"" Stokes had said. Stokes had a phenomenal run in the past one year as he helped England to the World Cup final victory and played a key role in his side's stunning Ashes win over Australia at Headingley. The 29-year-old, who has played 63 Tests since 2013, said positivity influences his conduct on the field and that will continue. The series will mark the resumption of international cricket since the COVID-19 pandemic brought all sporting activities to a standstill in March. ",

Calls for boycotting Chinese products have intensified after 20 Indian soldiers were killed in the Galwan Valley clash on June 15. The Chinese have so far refused to share details of the casualties they suffered. The incident prompted the BCCI to call a meeting of the IPL Governing Council to review Chinese sponsorships but that meeting is yet to take place. On Monday, India banned 59 Chinese apps. ""We should do it (sever ties with Chinese sponsors in IPL) for the sake of the nation. Country comes first, money is secondary. And it is the Indian Premier League, not the Chinese Premier League. It should leady by example and show the way,"" Wadia told PTI on Tuesday. ""Yes it would be difficult to find sponsors initially but I am sure there are enough Indian sponsors who can replace them. We must have all the respect for the nation and our government and most importantly for the soldiers who risk their lives for us,"" said the known Indian businessman. The Chinese soldiers used stones, nail-studded sticks, iron rods and clubs to carry out a brutal attack on Indian soldiers after they protested the erection of a surveillance post by China on the Indian side of the Line of Actual Control in Galwan. The incident was the biggest confrontation between the two militaries after their 1967 clashes in Nathu La when India lost around 80 soldiers while the death toll on the Chinese side stood well over 300. Chinese mobile phone maker Vivo is the IPL title sponsor and it pays the BCCI Rs 440 crore annually for the five-year deal ending in 2022. Other companies involved in the IPL -- Paytm, Swiggy, Dream 11 -- have Chinese investments. Not just the IPL, the teams too attract Chinese sponsorship. While Wadia made his stance clear, other teams, including Chennai Super Kings, said they will be happy to go with whatever the government decides. ""It will be tough to replace them initially but if it has to be done for the sake of the nation, we should do it,"" a CSK source told PTI. Another team owner said: ""Let the government decide first, whatever they decide, we will follow"". However, Wadia said it is not right to await government's directive on the controversial subject as ""it is our moral responsibility to stand with the nation at this hour"". ""If I was the BCCI president, I would say find me an Indian sponsor for the upcoming season. ""Indian companies need to step up and see the same benefits and opportunities that Chinese companies have seen in the IPL, which is the best T20 league in the world."" Asked about the Chinese sponsorship in IPL teams, Wadia said: ""The teams too should be given time to replace their Chinese sponsors. As I said, there are enough Indian companies which can replace them."" Wadia also welcomed the Indian government's decision to ban Chinese apps citing national security. ""If India plays its card right, it can really be the superpower it desires to be,"" he observed. ""Personally I don't like to buy Chinese products because they are sub-standard. The focus has to be on making Indian and buying Indian. China produces such large volumes and suffocates the world, it has to stop. We should put all our efforts on making India a manufacturing hub. ""I travel around the country a lot. If we don't stop the influx of cheap Chinese goods and are not firm in what we are doing, Indian manufacturing will die,"" cautioned Wadia. ",

Former captain Jayawardene played as many as 652 international matches across formats during a career spanning close to two decades. At the peak of his career, international cricket was flooded with world-class bowlers, something many feel is not the case now. ""We are yet to see if the current crop of bowlers will hit the numbers that their predecessors did... The present bowlers are probably up against better batting units,"" Jayawardene said during an ESPNcricinfo videocast with Sanjay Manjrekar. On facing bowling attacks across two decades, the legendary batsman said, ""If you look at the top 10 wicket-takers in modern day cricket all of them played in that era (first half of his career). ""I missed out on Walsh and Kapil as I started just after that. ""There was (Mutthiah) Murali ( Muralitharan), (Shane) Warne, (Glenn) McGrath, Anil (Kumble), Bhajji (Harbhajan Singh), Saqlain (Mushtaq), Wasim (Akram), Waqar (Younis), their numbers speak for themselves. ""The bowlers I faced in my career improved tremendously over the years."" Jayawardene revealed that he started out in cricket as a fast bowler cum batsman and recalled the time when he was allowed by his parents to skip his exams to play in Hong Kong Sixes, a six-a-side slam-bang tournament in the pre-T20 era. ""I was really proud of my parents as that became my stepping stone because I performed well in that tournament. ""In school cricket I was a fast bowler and batted at number three, but unfortunately, like all youngsters that time we were not put through proper training and fitness programme... ""... so later on when I improved and started playing first-class cricket, I had to give up fast bowling because I had some issues with my back. The advice was that I need to concentrate on my batting and not so much on my bowling, so I became a slow off-cutter."" Speaking further on his move to give up fast bowling, he said, ""I took the decision to give up bowling to have an effective career. I was fortunate to not miss a series because of a serious injury. No modern player plays without some type of niggle or other."" Asked about the illustrious former teammate Muralitharan, Jayawardene said the spin great was a difficult bowler ""to convince to do something he didn't want to"". ""Murali was a champion bowler even though he went about his game differently to others. Warne probably didn't have the variety that Murali had. Murali knew exactly what he was doing and believed in grinding a batsman down."" Initially, Murali refused to bowl from around the wicket to right-handers, but once he tasted success from bowling around the wicket, we couldn't stop him from doing it."" As the discussion turned to his long-time colleague Kumar Sangakkara, Jayawardene had only words of appreciation. ""He changed the way he batted over the years. The last six-seven years the numbers that he put on the board was phenomenal. I don't think any modern day cricketer has done that."" ",

Umar is presently serving a three-year ban for not reporting spot-fixing approaches but has appealed against the decision with an independent tribunal of the Pakistan Cricket Board. The date of the hearing is yet to be finalised. ""Off the field activities are nothing new in Pakistan cricket. Team management and captain should know how to deal with such players. Look at the way Inzi bhai (Inzamam-ul-Haq) handled Shoaib (Akhtar), (Mohammad) Asif and Shahid (Afridi). If the same was done with Umar Akmal, things would have turned out differently,"" he was quoted as saying by Cricket Pakistan website. Kamran also voiced his unhappiness at being kept out of the national team despite good performances in domestic cricket. ""I have been performing in domestic cricket and PSL (Pakistan Super League) during the last five years but despite that I have not been given a chance to play for Pakistan,"" he said. ""In the recent past, a couple of coaches did not like me which is why I remained on the sidelines. ""It's unfair to keep me out of the Test and T20I side, especially, because I can play solely as a batsman. If Matthew Wade can make a comeback with an average of 18-20, why not me who averages nearly 60,"" he added. Kamran last played for Pakistan in 2017 in the West Indies despite having a successful career in the national team during a career spanning 53 Tests, 157 ODIs and 58 T20s. Kamran also advised the national selectors to pick players on the basis of performances in domestic cricket rather than just the PSL, while also drawing parallels with Indian Premier League (IPL). ""Players are selected on performance in PSL, while those who have been doing well in domestic cricket are ignored. That's not how you make good teams,"" he said. ""If India started doing this, they would have the entire team selected from IPL. ""Tournaments like IPL and PSL are good for exposure and confidence but the performances that count come from four-day cricket,"" he concluded. ",

Aluthgamage has alleged that his country ""sold"" the game to India, a claim that was ridiculed by former captains Kumar Sangakkara and Mahela Jayawardene who demanded evidence from him. De Silva, the then chairman of selectors, was quizzed for over six hours by the police. Aluthgamage on June 18 made the allegation but later backtracked, saying it was just his suspicion. A special police investigation unit recorded Aluthgamage's statement last week. De Silva, who was the man of the match in the 1996 World Cup final which Sri Lanka won, was summoned by the police on Tuesday to record his statement. Police sources said that Upul Tharanga, the left-handed opener who played the 2011 final at Mumbai's Wankhede Stadium, would be quizzed next. Post Aluthgamage'ss allegation, De Silva has asked the BCCI to conduct its own investigation. De Silva said he was willing to travel to India to take part in an investigation despite the current COVID-19 pandemic. ",

Though bowlers have played a very big role in the tournament, power-hitters are the ones who have captured the imagination of the fans. Not surprisingly, many of the batsmen who have consistently fired over the course of a full season are traditional, classic batsmen and not pinch hitters. From modern-day greats like Virat Kohli, David Warner and Chris Gayle to a veteran like Michael Hussey, classy batsmen have ruled the roost. TimesofIndia.com here takes a look at the top five batsmen who have been the highest run-getters in a single edition of the IPL: Virat Kohli (2016) - 973 runsA consistent performer and a run machine across formats, Virat Kohli has been equally devastating when it comes to the IPL. Although the Royal Challengers Bangalore skipper is yet to lay his hands on the IPL silverware, his individual performances for his franchise (RCB) have been a class apart over the past 12 editions. And it was in 2016, when Kohli lit up franchise cricket's biggest extravaganza with a barrage of thunderous batting performances. With a total of 973 runs in 16 matches, Kohli in that edition went on to become the top run-getter. It's a record he still holds firmly. With as many as four centuries (the highest for a batsmen in one edition) and 7 fifties, Kohli, in that edition, was unstoppable. He hit the ball at a strike rate of over 152, at an average of over 81, which also included a total of 38 sixes and 83 fours, Kohli took every opposition apart, toying with their bowlers. Riding on Kohli's stupendous run, RCB in that edition, went on to reach the finals but lost eventually to Sunrisers Hyderabad to settle for second place. With a highest score of 113 and four unbeaten knocks, Kohli was the big individual hero of that season. David Warner (2016) - 848 runsAlthough Virat Kohli was in the spotlight through the 2016 IPL, but Sunrisers Hyderabad's David Warner gave him a run for his money with the bat. The Aussie is in second place on the all time list of highest run-getters in a single edition of the IPL. With 848 runs in 17 games, Warner had a stupendous 2016 edition. Warner's performance in the tournament helped SRH enter the final and win their maiden title. With an average of over 60, Warner had a phenomenal run in 2016, where he hit 9 crucial fifties -- giving his side a jump-start at the top on most occasions. The runs for Warner in that edition came at a strike rate of over 151, where he also managed a personal highest score of 93*. An integral part of the SRH setup, Warner has been as reliant as ever with his exceptional consistency setting him apart from the rest in the tournament Kane Williamson (2018) - 735 runsNew Zealand captain Kane Williamson has been known for his classy, subtle and well-crafted batting style, but he is also rated highly amongst the best power hitters in the world. He doesn't need to bludgeon the ball, but can clear the fence almost at will when he wants to switch gears. Williamson in 2018 filled the void created by David Warner's absence, Williamson, with additional responsibilities of being the skipper made the 2018 edition his own, showing his phenomenal skills as a leader and a batsman. With a total of 735 runs in 17 matches, Williamson was not only the highest run-getter in the tournament, but also took SRH to the finals of the competition. Scoring at an average of 52.50, Williamson, in that edition struck 8 fifties, providing much-needed strength to SRH at the top of the order. And the runs he scored at a strike rate of over 142 also played a huge role in Hyderabad's dominance through the tournament. Although they lost to Chennai Super Kings in the final, Williamson was the standout performer with the bat in the 2018 edition. Chris Gayle (2012) and Michael Hussey (2013) - 733 runsChris Gayle and Michael Hussey are the perfect examples of how two completely opposite batting styles can gel perfectly in a tournament like the IPL. While everyone is very well aware of what Gayle has brought to the T20 format, Hussey, with his elegance and class coupled with a ruthless attitude in taking apart bowling attacks proved that simple things such as timing the ball well can be equally fruitful in the format. Both Gayle and Hussey scored 733 runs in a single edition of the IPL (separate editions) and are joint fourth on the all-time leading run-scorers list in a season. While Gayle achieved the feat in the 2012 edition, playing for Royal Challengers Bangalore, Hussey replicated the same in the 2013 edition for Chennai Super Kings. For Gayle, his runs in 2012 came at the strike rate of 160, Hussey on the other hand, played in his natural style, although a bit aggressively -- scoring at a strike rate of just over 129 -- but always being the much needed anchor for the team. With a highest score of 128* and 95 respectively, both Gayle and Hussey emerged as the stars for their respective franchises in these two editions. Chris Gayle (2013) - 708 runsJamaican power-hitter Chris Gayle might now be in the twilight of his cricketing career, but what he did for T20 cricket will be remembered for generations to come. And his heroics with the bat were highlighted and enjoyed in the IPL as well. From the highest ever score in the competition (175*), to having one of the highest strike-rates, Gayle has been one of the stand out performers in the tournament over the years. It's no surprise then that he features again on this list. And it was during the 2013 edition that he showed signs of his consistent power-hitting, accumulating 708 runs for Royal Challengers Bangalore. After being the highest scorer in the previous edition (2012), Gayle continued his masterclass, the following season, emerging the second best behind Hussey in 2013. The 708 bruns he scored in 2013 puts him in fifth place on the list of highest run-scorers in the season. In 2013, Gayle played a total of 16 matches, where he scored his runs at a strike rate of over 156, which also included a ton and four fifties. It was in this season that Gayle scored his 175 not out -- the highest individual T20 score by a batsman. With 51 sixes and 57 fours Gayle batted in his usual dominant style in that season, once again showcasing his batting prowess to the world. ",

England players and staff have now had three COVID-19 tests. The ECB's announcement followed a statement from Pakistan that six more players had been cleared to join the tour after recording two successive negative COVID-19 tests. But the other four of the 10 players who originally tested positive for the virus last week will have to stay in Pakistan for now after failing further tests. Mohammad Hafeez, Wahab Riaz, Mohammad Hasnain, Shadab Khan, Mohammad Rizwan and Fakhar Zaman are now eligible to travel to England and join the original squad that left on Sunday, the Pakistan Cricket Board said. ""All the six players were re-tested on Monday, following their first negative test on June 26,"" the PCB confirmed. However, Imran Khan, Kashif Bhatti, Haider Ali and Haris Rauf tested positive for a second time. They will not be allowed to travel to England until they have recorded two consecutive negative tests. Pakistan will play three Tests and three Twenty20 internationals against England starting in August, with the exact dates still to be confirmed. The Pakistan squad arrived in England late Sunday and have started a 14-day mandatory quarantine period before intra-squad practice games. A 30-strong England squad and support staff are currently in a bio-secure training camp at the Ageas Bowl ahead of next week's opening Test against the West Indies. This first fixture in the three-match series will mark the return of major international cricket from lockdown. ",

Pioli said that Ibrahimovic, who returned for a second stint in January and injured his calf in training in late May during the coronavirus stoppage, was likely to be included in the squad for the match away to lowly SPAL on Wednesday. ""Ibrahimovic is doing well. He’s a lion, he’s always hungry. He had a great training session yesterday, if he repeats that today and gives me the all clear then he’ll be in the squad,"" Pioli told Milan's television channel. Milan, who dropped to 14th at one point this season, have lost only two matches since the start of the year and have climbed to seventh and may be on course for a Europa League place. Pioli was appointed in October to replace Marco Giampaolo, who was fired after only seven games of the season, and has slowly but surely begun to turn things around. ""It takes time to build a team and make it grow while implementing your own ideas. But we mustn’t look back, we have to live out these moments with full attention and intensity,"" said Pioli. ""There are 30 points up for grabs for us to try and achieve our goal. Our current average of two points a game is an excellent figure. We’re hoping to keep it up, and we’re hoping that it will be enough to qualify for Europe."" ",

The March 15 race in Melbourne was cancelled before a wheel had turned, and Formula One has had to wait more than 100 days for another opportunity to go racing after countries went into lockdown. Sunday's opener at Spielberg's Red Bull Ring will be the latest ever start to a Formula One season, and the first to get going in Austria. It will take place in a changed landscape, one without spectators or sponsors present while teams operate in 'bubbles' with strict health and safety conditions and media kept at a distance. ""I have to say I'm very happy with the plan that has been developed,"" said Seidl. ""What is different now to Australia is we have a clear concept of isolation of the teams between each other,"" added the German. ""The approach is clear: If someone is positive he needs to be isolated from the team and obviously can't continue. but for everyone else who is not affected or is negative, they can simply keep going."" All the teams have backup staff on standby, tested and ready to step in if needed. In Melbourne, amid general concern about racing in the face of a growing pandemic, McLaren withdrew on the Thursday after one positive result. The race was then called off before the start of Friday practice. Team members will now be tested every five days and will also have to maintain self distancing and wear face masks in the paddock. Seidl said all of his team's tests had reported negative so far. The teams, who will fly in on charter planes and remain isolated in their hotels, will not mix with locals or rival outfits, with key groups kept isolated within teams to limit any spread. ""I think it is a good mix of protecting our people and at the same time allowing to put up a good show,"" Seidl said. ",

Earlier in the day, The Central Board of Secondary Education (CBSE) and the Indian Certificate of Secondary Education (ICSE) submitted before the Supreme Court that the board examination results will be declared by July 15.

ICSE, on the other hand, told the top court that they might give an option to the class 10 students to write the exams at a later stage as well.

After completing the year-long course in 2018, she is now working as an economist with the Department for International Trade, Government of UK. She is also the South-East Regional Lead and Diversity & Inclusion Co-Lead for Civil Service’s Network for Nature.


""The opportunity to delve into cutting-edge research or converse with the best brains involved in it is in itself a whetting tool for those eager to learn. The UK provides this prospect to the students through its advanced educational system,"" says Koyesha (23), who hails from Jamshedpur, Jharkhand. Her mother is an
English teacher and father is a financial consultant.

University ratings, staff quality and positive student feedback further strengthened her decision to pursue post-graduation from the UK.

Recipient of KN Jain Memorial Gold Medal for academic excellence, Koyesha pursued a bachelor's in Economics from Loreto College, Kolkata (2014-2017). This was followed by postgraduation at the University of Manchester, where she received the highest score for her dissertation on 'Climate Change, Price Stability and Implications for Green Financing'. 

 
Course structure
MSc Development Economics and Policy is a course offered jointly by the School of Social Sciences and the Global Development Institute (one of the world's leading institutes globally in development research) within the University of Manchester.

""Development Economics is a sub-field of Economics and the course contents include core modules on Economics, Statistics, Econometrics and Mathematics. The focus of this course was to explore developmental issues around the world - poverty, labour migration, climate change, governance, inequality, trade barriers etc. It was an insightful learning programme that taught me about endemic economic issues in different countries and developing a global approach to basic developmental challenges,"" says Koyesha.

A major takeaway from the course for her, she says, is learning the importance of data in analysing developmental issues from grass root level and charting a policy solution based on that evidence. The university also provided access to top-rated, international journals and papers in the library that helped with the subject study immensely. ""I have been able to implement this theoretical knowledge in drafting the trade policy for the UK,"" she adds.


Working in the UK
Job prospects in the UK depend largely on the subject one is pursuing. ""It is relatively easier to get placed and be granted a sponsored work visa for jobs that are listed in the shortage occupancy list in the UK such as IT, engineering or nursing,"" says Koyesha. Her job role as an economist was however not under this category and the chances of her getting through were bleak.

""The strong academic profile and in-depth knowledge acquired in the UK turned things in my favour,"" she says.

As an economist, Koyesha's job revolves around drafting UK's trade policies with other nations. ""This has been a particularly exciting and challenging work over the last year as it is all being done for the first time in the Brexit aftermath with no precedence to refer to.""

Earlier, as part of the European Union (EU), UK followed policies outlined by union. After Brexit, the country will have to reconfigure its international trade policy. 

 ""The job involves analysing and monitoring excess imports of goods into the UK from other countries that affect domestic industries, conducting international visits, calculating the appropriate level of tariffs to set off the injury and also drafting trade polices to execute this entire process in practice,"" she says.


Developing a global network
An education abroad helps one cultivate a network across geographies and is an enriching experience, says Koyesha, who made some lifelong friends from countries around the world.

The diversity of the international student community that the UK attracts creates a comfortable camaraderie to tune into its rich culture instantly

Many have been preparing for the entrance exams for two years to get a seat in a good medical or engineering college, and are now apprehensive about the indefinite delay. A group of parents wrote to the National Testing Agency (NTA) requesting NEET be conducted per the revised schedule, on July 26. 


""The speculation over the further postponement of NEET has created panic among the students causing damage to their mental health. Students need a break from the pressure. There is no social interaction during the lockdown, and the delay in holding the exam is only leading to additional stress among aspirants. Exams can be conducted by making masks, gloves, and shields compulsory in the exam centres,"" wrote the parents in the letter.

NEET aspirant Tanvi Kulkarni said they are running like marathoners with no finish line in sight. ""The preparation is tough and the exam is highly competitive. We cannot afford to slip at this stage. But for two months now, we have been repeating and revising the same topics. What if monotony sets in? What if we go blank on the day of the exam?"" She added, ""Cancelling the exam is not a solution, as there is no parity in the way different boards evaluate students. Most students would want the pressure to end soon. But if there is a need, the government should postpone the exam and not cancel it,"" said Tanvi.

An online petition signed by close to 40,000 people seeks postponement of both the national-level exams. ""Writing exams in masks and gloves, and with the fear of Covid, could add to the stress. How can the government hold entrance exams when the whole country is dealing with a pandemic,"" said a student. 

Ruiee Kapoor, a parent representative who also wrote to the NTA, said the MHRD should come up with a solution soon, as students will lose hope and morale if it is delayed further. ""Those who have been consistent in their studies from the beginning are going through a rough phase as many prepare with a target. It will be a great loss if these students break down towards the end,"" said Kapoor. The JEE (Main) exams are scheduled to be held from July 18 to 23. While there have been speculations over the postponement of the exam, the MHRD is yet to officially take any decision.

Earlier this week, Sawant had clarified that online classes were not compulsory, as many students did not have gadgets and proper internet facilities.

In a release, the Higher Secondary Teachers' Association has questioned why the state government had asked schools to start online classes for Classes 11 and 12 in the first place.

""Earlier, the chief minister had said that due to the COVID-19 pandemic, there will be a delay in reopening of schools. Accordingly, teachers were trained by the department of education for online classes,"" president of the association Anant Pissurlekar said.

However, Sawant's latest announcement has led to a decline in the number of students attending online classes, with many who were initially attending also opting out, he claimed.

""If these online classes were not beneficial, then why did they ask us to conduct them in the first place?"" he asked.

Meanwhile, a senior official of the education department said the decision to not make online classes compulsory was taken after several parents complained about lack of internet connectivity.

""Some parents also found it difficult to buy gadgets such as laptops and mobile phones, which are required for virtual schooling,"" he said, adding that the chief minister had made these reasons amply clear in his announcement.

Our body requires water for basic chemical reactions to take place. When we don't drink enough water, our bodies can't function at their best. That is why, as dehydration sets in, you start feeling fatigued. Be it the winter season or summer, it's of paramount importance to keep your body hydrated for its optimal functioning. 

When we feel hot, the brain alerts the sweat glands to produce sweat. That is how the body cools down itself. If dehydrated, the body cannot sweat enough to stay cool. 

Water helps regulate the bowel movements, maintain the body temperature, maintain the blood volume, lubricate the joints, prevent UTI, kidney stones and more. 

We often take care of our water intake and know when to have it. But with small kids who cannot express themselves, it's tough to know if they are properly hydrated. 

The amount of water kids need depends on their sex and age. Other factors on which the water intake depends is the temperature, humidity, activity level and the overall health of the person. 


Here is a simple chart to guide you on how much water your kid should have.
These recommendations are set of generally healthy kids who live in a moderate climate, thus might not be exact for everyone. 

Boys 4-8 years - 1.1 to 1.3 litres per day

Girls 4-8 years - 1.1 to 1.3 litres per day

Girls 9 -13 years - 1.3 to 1.5 litres per day.

Boys 9 - 13 years - 1.5 to 1.7 litres per day.

The above data is from The European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) on how much fluid children need.

However, if you have a small balcony or a little open space in your house, you can grow some herbs and greens at home that don’t require a lot of care and attention. Here are a few…

 
Herbs like thyme, mint and basilHerbs are one of the easiest to grow at home. In a place like Bengaluru, where the weather is mostly pleasant, herbs grow well. You can begin with thyme, mint and basil. Just pot the seeds and keep the pot on a window sill or in a place with moderate sunlight.

 
Chilli
Chillies grow well in Bengaluru weather. Sow the seeds in a pot that has plenty of moisture and minerals. Water on a regular basis, however avoid over watering till germination.In a few weeks’ time, the plant will bear chillies.

 
Spinach
Another easy green to grow, spinach grows well in a cool atmosphere (in Bengaluru, ideally between June and December). Sow the seeds and place the pot in a well-lit area. Spinach grows well in small areas or pots and containers.

 
Tomato
Once you sow the seeds, water it on a regular basis. Make sure that the pot receives plenty of sunlight. If you see the leaves droop, water it. Tomato plants take a few weeks’ time before bearing any fruit.

 
Coriander
Before you sow the seeds, make sure that you crush them gently between your palms, resulting in the seeds to split. Once this is done, sow them and water them regularly.

 
A few tips…


 Make sure that the soil you use has all the necessary nutrients. If you are unsure, buy a potting mix or natural fertilizers that can be added to the soil
 Avoid over and under watering, as it can cause the roots to rot 
 Be patient. Though the above mentioned herbs and greens are easy to grow, not all grow at a rapid pace

https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/life-style/relationships/love-sex/coronavirus-has-taught-men-how-to-cook-and-do-household-chores-but-is-it-a-lesson-learned-for-life/articleshow/76686757.cms,2020-06-29 15:59:00,Coronavirus has taught men how to cook and do household chores. But is it a lesson learned for life?,"The Bharadwaj household has a noticeably different start every morning. Vivek Bharadwaj (name changed), a busy marketing expert before the lockdown started, is seen mostly washing the dishes from the night before as his wife Ayushi Sharma is busy preparing her 5-year-old son for his online classes. Once Vivek leaves the kitchen spick and span, the mound of unwashed dishes now gone, the cooktop devoid of oil and grime and the floor scrubbed to perfection, it's Ayushi's turn to take over the kitchen. While she readies breakfast and prepares for lunch, Vivek looks after the fidgety toddler's schoolwork while getting ready to work from home. As the clock strikes 9, they are served breakfast, and Ayushi, who has eaten hurridly while serving their breakfast, now starts her day's work of a busy accountant. 

Afternoons are no different. Like the hands of a clock, both Ayushi and Vivek work together in unmatched synchronisation—if Ayushi prepares lunch, Vivek will take the duty of serving it. And thus, their life during the pandemic ran smooth, without any help from a third person. Among the many lessons that most men have learned during Cornonavirus, cooking and doing household chores are life skills that would definitely help them become a better and stronger person. However, the big question is will the man of the house continue doing household chores or helping the womenfolk in the kitchen after the pandemic is over and life returns to normal?


 


For Bhaskar Majumdar, a Delhi-based strategic communication specialist, Covid 19 and the following lockdown have been a period of great self-realisation and self-learning for him. His wife and son went to Dibrugarh, Assam, on March 19 and unfortunately, they got stuck there due to the lockdown. ""I never imagined that I will have to manage the house all by myself. From cooking to cleaning and managing everything on my own without any help, it was a great learning process for me."" Bhaskar who has been sharing some interesting pictures of food cooked by him on social media, said, ""I have realised that not only can I cook for survival, in fact, I can cook quite well and that too exotic dishes, besides the regular ones. This lockdown has made me realise that I have culinary skills and now my family is back but I have continued cooking. It's a huge stress buster for me and my family is also quite amazed by my culinary skills. Along with cooking I have also enrolled and completed a few online courses and I never thought that I will start learning again at this age.""


 


Anuj Kumar Boruah, a communication entrepreneur and resident of Noida, is very positive and enthusiastic about the changes that the pandemic-induced lockdown has brought in his life. Telling us about his childhood, Anuj shared how he and his two brothers grew up doing household chores as they watched their father help their mother since both were working professionals. But hostel life and later, as he got married, he gradually stopped doing household chores and helping in the kitchen as he got busy in his professional life. ""You see, my wife Kalyanee and I led a very busy life after marriage as both were working full time. Soon our daughter Kuhi arrived in our lives and we became totally dependant on our helpers—one who cleaned the house and the other took care of the cooking. When the lockdown started and we no longer had the luxury of getting external help, we divided the chores between us—while Kalyani looked after cooking, I gladly took over the charge of cleaning."" Anuj, who seemed quite glad about taking charge of household chores, said it's been quite an eye-opener. ""We have learnt a very important lesson about being self-dependent. Of course, I will continue doing the same even after the lockdown is over."" Pointing at the health benefits of doing chores, Anuj added, ""Also, I have realised during these two months how cleaning and scrubbing is a great form of exercise. Well, it can be counted as a workout when we hardly have any physical activities to keep fit, right?""


Hopefully, the pandemic might have taught millions of men an important lesson—doing household chores is not just a women's task. Unfortunately, when men choose to do household chores, their act is glorified and is often counted as 'helping' rather than 'responsibility'. We hope just like Vivek, Anuj and Bhaskar, other men too would take this opportunity to learn a few life skills and continue doing the same even after the lockdown is over and as our life returns to normal.

https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/life-style/food-news/replacement-of-eggs-in-pastry-making/articleshow/76686175.cms,2020-06-29 13:41:00,Replacement of eggs in pastry making,"A lot of people may not consume eggs for several reasons that include being vegetarian by choice, culture or religion, allergies, dislike towards the taste or also a particular diet, like veganism. And hence there’s always a need to convert an egg based recipe into an eggless one.
Eggs play a pivotal role in a recipe from cakes and cookies to meringues and pastry cream — whole eggs create structure and stability within a batter, they help in binding and providing sufficient moisture to hold the ingredients together, egg yolks help thicken and emulsify sauces and custards, they add moisture to cakes and other baked goods, and can even act as glue or glaze, egg whites can be whipped to create an egg white foam. This foam is filled with tons of air which helps to lighten and leaven baked goods
However, there are some places we just cannot replace the eggs. If a recipe calls for more than 4 eggs, it is important to remember if you substitute this quantity you will end up with a completely different product, owing to texture, fluffiness, taste etc.
When we are looking to replace eggs in a recipe, we need to understand the role of an ingredient and the purpose we are substituting it for.
It can be broadly divided into four categories:

1. Binding
2. Moisture
3. Leavening
4. Thickening/ Emulsifying

The following lists the various ingredients that can be used as a replacement for eggs.


1. Fruit purees
Mashed Bananas, apple sauce, pumpkin puree, avocado. Pureed fruits that have high pectin content works great as pectin enhances the binding effect.
Adds moisture to baked goods, also works well as a binder. Sweet purees can be added for quick breads and cakes, brownies and muffins. It is important to remember that they also impart a strong flavour. It also results in a fairly dense product.
Pureed fruits that have high pectin content works great as pectin enhances the binding effect.
¼ cup of Puree for every 50gms of Egg / 1 egg.


2. Flaxseeds / chia seeds 
Flax seeds are a versatile ingredient. Popularly called as flax egg, it is made by grinding the flax seed into a fine powder and then combining it with water to form a gel like texture.
The flaxseed meal absorbs water and becomes gelatinous. Also imparts a nutty flavour to the product.
How it works?
The outer seed coating of a flaxseed contains a gum that becomes really thick once ground and mixed with water. This new thicker substance works as a great emulsifier and binder, helping the structure of baked goods.
How to make?
For flax egg – 1 tbsp of flaxseed dissolved in 3 tbsp of water, allow to gelatinize for 10-15 mins, replaces 1 egg / 50gms of egg.
For flax meringue – Bring to a boil, then simmer 1/3rd cup flax seeds in 3 cups of water till slimy, strain, chill it, then whipped. It isn’t bake stable, but can be used as a meringue in mousses, buttercream, puddings, purees to lighten and add airy textures. Can also be sweetened with sugar.


3. Silken tofu
Silken tofu is creamier, lighter than regular cotton tofu. It makes the product slightly dense, but works great as substitute in pancakes, brownies, custards, pies and quick breads.
It needs to be beaten and made creamy before being used. It can also be mixed with a little water or liquid to ensure more moistness.
To substitute for the custard in a quiche, blend silken tofu with milk or cream till smooth.
¼ cup Silken tofu replaces 1 egg/ 50gms of egg.


4. Nut butters
Nut butters make a healthy substitute, full of healthy fats, just like eggs. They add a strong flavour to the final product. Also adds fibre and protein to the baked goods. Any nut like, peanut, cashew, almond, walnuts, pecans, pistachio can be used.
To make nut butter, roast the nuts in a pan or in the oven, blend in a mixer with a little sugar and oil as required to make it creamy. 
It works as a great binding agent in cookies, pancakes, waffles, brownies and muffins. 
3tbsp of nut butter replaces 1 egg / 50 gms of egg.


5. Yoghurt
Preferable Greek yoghurt to be used as it doesn’t contain water/ whey. If using regular yoghurt hang it for a while and then use with as little water as possible. 
Yoghurt works great to provide moisture, to keep a product soft and also aids in activating Baking soda, which makes goods fluffy and light. Mainly used in cakes and brownies. It can also result in a slightly dense product.
1/4th cup yoghurt replaces 1 egg/ 50 gms of egg.


6. Buttermilk
Buttermilk can be used in a similar manner to yoghurt, for binding and to add moisture to a cake. 
1/4th cup of buttermilk + baking soda can be used to replace 1 egg.


7. Milk
Milk is the most versatile ingredient that can be used as a replacement for eggs, mainly in binding and for moisture.

Given the limited availability of resources and reduced garbage collection due to the ongoing lockdown, people across Bengaluru are switching to zero-waste cooking, making complete use of the fruits and vegetables in their fridge — peels, seeds and all. While vegetable peel is finding its way into chutneys, fruit peel is ending up in delicious jams. Even the bones from your roast chicken can be used to make a broth or stock.


Chutneys, fryums from peel
One such household that follows the concept of zero-waste cooking, is that of actress Pranitha Suhash. Citing an example, she says, “We prepare ridge gourd curry, for which the vegetable minus the outer skin is used. This is used to make palya. The peel is then ground with other ingredients to make chutney. That way, the entire vegetable is used and there is no waste generated.”
South Indian cuisine allows for chutneys to be made from the peel of cucumber, ridge gourd or chow chow, adds actress Sudharani. “Orange peel can be used to make gojju. The outer skin of pumpkin can be dried, deep fried and eaten as a fryum and the seeds too, can be dried and eaten. You end up consuming the whole vegetable,” she points out.


One-pot meals reduce waste
Another way to ensure minimal or no waste, is by opting for one-pot meals. “Ever since the lockdown, I realised that these meals not only generate less waste, but also help save water,” Sudharani adds.
Chef and restaurateur Abhijit Saha, too, advocates cooking one-pot meals as a healthier alternative to an elaborate spread. “One-pot meals like soups or baked dishes with a lot of vegetables are a good idea,” he says.


Seed-based Juice or shakes?
Raja, who owns a zero-waste juice bar, ensures that every part of the fruit is utilised. He tells us how we can ensure the same at home. “The skin of fruits can be used in various ways — pineapple skin can be boiled to make a delicious drink with a dash of lime and ginger. If you have jackfruit seeds, they can be used to make a milkshake. And if you have guava seeds, dry them and grind them into a powder. This can be used as a garnish. I use it on ice cream and it is highly nutritious,” he shares. Leftover citrus rind makes for a cool garnish for cakes and cocktails too.


A few tips to help you embrace zero-waste cooking...


 Use the skin of watermelon and chow-chow to make curries
 Orange rind can be used to make marmalade
 Chopped banana peel, when added to your garden pots, releases potassium and small amounts of nitrogen and phosphorus, which benefit the plants
 Stalks of mint and coriander can be used in soups, juices and smoothies

While the rest of her followers commented on how stunning she looks, there's another user who asked Shefali, 'Chinese main kyu likha hai t-shirt pai (why is the text written in Chinese on the t-shirt).

 

It's due to the tension at the India-China border that several in the country have called for a ban on Chinese products including popular celebs. Last evening the announcement on the ban of 59 Chinese apps also met with approval from the celebs.

While Nia Sharma said, ""Thank you for saving our country. This Virus named Tik tok should never be allowed again!"" Kamya Punjabi tweeted, "" ""Superbbbbbbb @PMOIndia excellent news #JaiHind #BoycottChineseProducts #BoycottChineseApps""

Reason: He wasn’t happy with the way his character was shaping up. Kuldeep, who had joined the show in 2017, shares, “There is no scope for my character to grow on the show and there’s nothing for me to explore as an artiste. The storyline has shifted its focus on Parvati (Akanksha Puri) and Kartikeya (Basant Bhatt).

It may seem like an overnight decision, but he had been contemplating to quit for some time now. He says, “My track lost its relevance last year and I had been thinking of quitting the show since then. However, the production house convinced me to stay put by saying that they were coming up with a new track, which will have me in the focus, too. But, that never happened. So, rather than waiting endlessly, I decided to leave the show. They tried to persuade me again, but I don’t trust them now.”

The actor is also concerned about his health and safety, and doesn’t want to step out to work amidst the rising number of coronavirus cases. He says, “That is also one of the reasons. For me, health comes first. I have heard about many actors leaving their respective shows because of the pandemic. As actors, we are exposed to the virus more than anyone else on a TV set, as we don’t wear a mask while shooting. So, while I was already planning to quit the show, the COVID-19 crisis added to it.”

Kuldeep now wants to get back to work with a more promising role. He says, “I have been offered a few projects. I only want to play a lead character now, because a TV show revolves around just three-four characters.”

Paras' new tattoo suits him and is all about positivity, the old one didn't suit him. This is nice,"" said Mahira.

Talking about her bond with Paras, Mahira said, ""Our bond has been strong in the Bigg Boss house and it is genuine and that's the reason it did not change. We are still in regular touch. In fact, during the first week only I had told him that I like him because he is real. He is very transparent and can never hide his feelings.""

Mahira shares that though they stood for each other in the Bigg Boss 13 house and were thick friends, she had her doubts, but now she knows he is her forever friend, ""In the Bigg Boss house we were good friends, but I had my doubts as many a times people fake friendships for game and also he had someone outside. I trusted him, but somewhere I had my doubts. When we came out and I got a chance to know Paras even better, I realised he is the best person to be with. He is amazing and a nice person. No matter what people try to portray him, they will never be successful in their agenda. He is a good person and that will always come across. I have very few friends in life as I don't get along with everyone and I knew with Paras my friendship is going to be forever. He is a kind of a person, who will always stay with you if you are his friend,"" she said.

Paras was dating Akanksha Puri and the two had got each other's names inked on their wrists, while they were in love. However, after Paras went inside their equation changed due to his closeness with inmate, Mahira Sharma. Akanksha announced breakup while Paras was inside and removed a tattoo of his name in February this year.

And the lead pair Sehban Azim and Reem Shaikh are quite excited to be back on the set.

""I am very happy. It's overwhelming and emotional at the same time. Lockdown 
mein ghar baith kar kaafi realisations 
hue - 
zindagi kahan jaa rahi thi, 
zarooratein kitni thi - 
bahut kuch seekha bhi. And I will keep all of this in my mind forever,"" says Sehban. Reem adds, ""It felt great to meet my 'THR' family again. I was missing my co-actors a lot. 
Sab pehle jaisa hi 
hai, 
bass ab log mask 
laga rahe hain, face shields 
ke through 
baat karte hain. But it's the new normal, I guess.""


 
Sehban says all safety measures are in place and work is on in full swing. ""We are taking all the necessary precautions on the set, there's sanitisers wherever you go, our crew members wear PPE kits and face shields. We are all doing our hair and makeup ourselves. In fact, I used to do my makeup myself before as well. 
Ab lag raha hai zindagi wapas track 
par aa rahi hai and I think our industry is also ready now,"" he tells us.



 While she is back to work, Reem still thinks that it's not completely safe to resume shoots amid the pandemic. ""Honestly, I don't think it's safe, but work never stops. We have to entertain people and here we are. Yes, we are taking all the precautions, but it's a little worrisome on the set. Although our set is being sanitised regularly, it still doesn't feel safe to touch anything there. I just hope that we all stay safe,"" she shares.

It all started when recently, Bigg Boss fame Dolly Bindra tweeted a video of him singing the famous song 'Duniya mein rehna hai toh kaam kar pyaare' from Haathi Mere Saathi in front of a vegetables laden cart. The video on a popular app gained views in millions and soon people mistook Javed Hyder for facing financial crunch. However, in an exclusive conversation with ETimes TV, Javed clarified that he is not dealing with any monetary issues and if in future things go wrong for him, he won't mind selling vegetables as no job is small.




""I am not selling vegetables. I am an actor by profession and currently because of lockdown, I am not doing anything. As an actor to keep myself busy and occupied I started making musical videos on an App. My daughter was using that App and she encouraged me to make some videos. Everyone is dealing with stress. People are committing suicide, they are facing financial crunch, they don't have work, seeing the situation that we all are in currently in I thought of making videos. I know so many artists who are dealing with lack of work. So, initially, I started off by putting a few videos with good messages. Then one day I took permission from a vegetable vendor and shot a video with his (thela) vegetable cart. Suddenly, the video started doing well and it crossed over 1 million views. I was very happy and the actor in me who was very sad because of the lockdown got excited. After that I started making videos to motivate people that no job is small. Today, with God's grace I don't have any monetary issues, but if at all it happens in future I won't shy from selling vegetables as no job is small,"" said Javed.




The actor also went on to confirm that he did try to reach out to Dolly Bindra to clarify that he is not a vegetable vendor and is just making videos to motivate people, ""A lot of people commented on my video thanking me that I have encouraged them to not give up in life, they actually thought I was facing financial crunch. There were so many positive messages. The second video also got viral. Then one day my friend called me and informed me about Dolly Bindra's tweet that I have no work and hence I am selling vegetables. I read her message on social media and replied to her that the information is wrong and I am an actor and not a vegetable vendor. I continued to make videos as I saw it is motivating people to earn and I felt if I am able to touch a few people's life through this video, there's nothing wrong in it,"" he said.

When asked how he is surviving in the lockdown, Javed said, ""The last big film I did was Dabangg 3 and it was a super hit. We shifted to a new flat in March first week and soon the lockdown was announced. We were shell shocked initially because we had just shifted and we had exhausted a lot of money. Then, there were a few friends who were going through a tough time so I decided to help them too. Because I thought the lockdown would be lifted after 21 days, but it continues for four months now. Also I am an actor. At the end of the day,I was getting frustrated because I wanted to work. That's when I started making these videos. But thankfully we had savings and money.""

Javed, who started off his career in films in the 80s as a child actor and has worked in films like Baap Numberi Beta Dus Numberi, Khudgarz, Ram Jaane opened up about the challenges he had to faced to find work when he entered adulthood, ""I had signed a film with Aamir Khan, Ghulaam and I was to play his best friend, but the film got stuck for two years. Later, when it got revived there were several changes made. Aamir's character had four friends and a new girl Rani Mukerji was signed. You know what happens with child actors there comes a stage in life when they are no more a kid and that's when it gets difficult to find work. I saw a lot of ups and downs during that period. But slowly I started getting work and I got many films. I belong to a not so well to do family. I used to stay in a chawl in Bandra east, but things changed for me after Shatrughan Sinha's Khudgarz where I played his childhood role. But then there was also a time when I did not get work for a year or six months. There were times when I was sacked from projects, but kept struggling and got work,"" said he.

After a few months of conducting live auditions from confines of home, with TV shoots resuming, the makers are going to air new audition episodes from various parts of the country that were held long before the lockdown was announced.

ETimes TV exclusively spoke to Roadies gangleader Raftaar regarding what’s in store for this reality show once the audition process is over. The show, which usually travels all over the country with cast, contestants and crew members, Raftaar gave a lowdown on what to expect. Excerpts from the chat:


What to expect in Roadies Revolution owing to the new norm of shoot?

We’re all reeling under a major health crisis right now and it certainly is a tough phase for all of us. Given the current situation, it’s difficult to specify how the on-ground shoots would look like. While we’re all set to be back with a bang, what is of primal importance right now is the safety of the crew. We would definitely be cognizant of all the health advisories and abide by the directives of the health ministry for the well-being of our Roadies family. Having said that, Roadies has continued to ride on its popularity and craze amongst the youth and so the undying passion of becoming a Roadie would remain at the core in this season as well.


Going by the new rules and regulations, what precautions are going to be followed?

Well we are going to maintain social distancing, limited on-ground manpower participation and basic sanitisation rules. I guess the channel crew will also monitor medial status of every member on-site.


Certain tasks require contestants' close proximity, many times gang leaders also get involved in their tasks. How are you going to handle such a situation?

According to me there will be technological inclusions in the show where physical presence isn’t required to handle such situations.


Working from home experience while conducting live auditions

Undeniably, working from home was hard. We’re so used to our routine of being outdoors, recording in the studio, that this ‘new normal’ felt bizarre. Roadies LIVE audition was a breather from the on-ground madness. The response was fabulous and we enjoyed every bit of the audition virtually. We saw a supremely talented bunch of contestants who came with a vision of doing something good for the country and add meaning to their lives. Also, we could see that the craze of being on the show really excites them beyond imagination. It was truly an enriching experience interacting with them and getting to know so many different aspects of life. We’re all pumped up now for the journey ahead.


Gang leaders’ role this season

Like every year, we’re here to guide our teams to go the extra mile and ace every task. This time, we as celebrity leaders, will hold the fort and get head-on with our counterparts to be at the top. All of us will strive to stir a revolution and do our bit for a good cause. Due to the pandemic crisis, we aim to unite and put some efforts in normalizing things and help those in need. We as leaders are here to guide the contestants to excel in the tasks as well as their lives. A lot of focus will be put on mental health awareness.


You won last season, what is going to be your strategy this season?

I believe the best strategy is to not make any and just go with the flow. I follow this mantra in life and encourage my team also to implement the same. We take up every challenge as it comes and try to excel with utmost sincerity and dedication. If you’re honest with your game, nothing can stop you from being at the top!


As this season talks about revolution, what is expected from the contestants?

This year, we at Roadies Revolution are looking for contestants who have it in them to drive social change. Our ‘Roadie’ should be more focused and driven towards the ideology of giving it back to the society. They should be aware of what’s going around the world right now and how we as individuals can become creators of change. Having said that, like every season, this one would also demand contestants to be focused, passionate, and fit with a great presence of mind to play a good game and make it to the top.

Here are some of the points that will determine the amount of your home loan:1. DownpaymentUsually builders ask buyers to pay 10-20 per cent of the value of the property as downpayment. Rest 80-90 per cent can be financed from the bank. You can choose to pay more from your pocket if you can afford. You must save up for the downpayment before finalaysing a property. In case, there is a deficit, you might have take soft loan from your employer, family and friends. Try to minimise the borrowing amount to reduce the interest outgo. 2. Your eligibility Home loan lenders have a list of eligibility criterion and only if you happen to meet those, you are considered a potential borrower. Banks typically look at your credit history to understand your repayment habits and prefer a credit score of 750 for lending out. Your age, income, occupation, collateral security, margin requirements, etc. are also important factors when it comes to determining the interest on the loan. 3. Your affordability of paying EMIsMany times buyers take up a lot of burden when it comes to paying EMI thinking that it would get easier with time, as their income would increase eventually. Consider the possibilities of not getting a raise soon or other unforeseen circumstances. You should look at a loan to income ratio of 20% to 30%. You can make changes in the tenure to reduce or increase the EMI amount depending on your affordability. ",

Besides the respiratory issues that leave patients gasping for breath, the virus that causes Covid-19 attacks many organ systems, in some cases causing catastrophic damage. ""We thought this was only a respiratory virus. Turns out, it goes after the pancreas. It goes after the heart. It goes after the liver, the brain, the kidney and other organs. We didn't appreciate that in the beginning,"" said Dr. Eric Topol, a cardiologist and director of the Scripps Research Translational Institute in La Jolla, California. In addition to respiratory distress, patients with Covid-19 can experience blood clotting disorders that can lead to strokes, and extreme inflammation that attacks multiple organ systems. The virus can also cause neurological complications that range from headache, dizziness and loss of taste or smell to seizures and confusion. And recovery can be slow, incomplete and costly, with a huge impact on quality of life. The broad and diverse manifestations of Covid-19 are somewhat unique, said Dr. Sadiya Khan, a cardiologist at Northwestern Medicine in Chicago. With influenza, people with underlying heart conditions are also at higher risk of complications, Khan said. What is surprising about this virus is the extent of the complications occurring outside the lungs. Kahn believes there will be a huge healthcare expenditure and burden for individuals who have survived Covid-19. LENGTHY REHAB FOR MANY Patients who were in the intensive care unit or on a ventilator for weeks will need to spend extensive time in rehab to regain mobility and strength. ""It can take up to seven days for every one day that you're hospitalized to recover that type of strength,"" Kahn said. ""It's harder the older you are, and you may never get back to the same level of function."" While much of the focus has been on the minority of patients who experience severe disease, doctors increasingly are looking to the needs of patients who were not sick enough to require hospitalization, but are still suffering months after first becoming infected. Studies are just getting underway to understand the long-term effects of infection, Jay Butler, deputy director of infectious diseases at the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, told reporters in a telephone briefing on Thursday. ""We hear anecdotal reports of people who have persistent fatigue, shortness of breath,"" Butler said. ""How long that will last is hard to say."" While coronavirus symptoms typically resolve in two or three weeks, an estimated 1 in 10 experience prolonged symptoms, Dr. Helen Salisbury of the University of Oxford wrote in the British Medical Journal on Tuesday. Salisbury said many of her patients have normal chest X-rays and no sign of inflammation, but they are still not back to normal. ""If you previously ran 5k three times a week and now feel breathless after a single flight of stairs, or if you cough incessantly and are too exhausted to return to work, then the fear that you may never regain your previous health is very real,"" she wrote. Dr. Igor Koralnik, chief of neuro-infectious diseases at Northwestern Medicine, reviewed current scientific literature and found about half of patients hospitalized with Covid-19 had neurological complications, such as dizziness, decreased alertness, difficulty concentrating, disorders of smell and taste, seizures, strokes, weakness and muscle pain. Koralnik, whose findings were published in the Annals of Neurology, has started an outpatient clinic for Covid-19 patients to study whether these neurological problems are temporary or permanent. Kahn sees parallels with HIV, the virus that causes AIDS. Much of the early focus was on deaths. ""In recent years, we've been very focused on the cardiovascular complications of HIV survivorship,"" Kahn said. ",

The modelling study, published in the European Respiratory Journal, found that the Covid-19 pandemic could significantly increase the global burden of TB. It estimates at least 110,000 additional deaths from TB in India, China, and South Africa unless health services maintained and strengthened. The researchers from the London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine (LSHTM) and Lancaster University in the UK noted that before Covid-19 outbreak, over 4,000 people were dying from TB every day. They estimated additional TB deaths and cases in China, India and South Africa over the next five years by examining the impact of various reductions in social contacts and on health services due to Covid-19. They hypothesised that social distancing might reduce TB incidence as Mycobacterium tuberculosis, the bacteria which causes the disease, is transmitted via droplets in the air -- similar to the coronavirus. However, even after taking into account this potential reduced TB transmission, the most likely scenario was estimated to result in more than 110,000 additional TB deaths, according to the researchers. In the worst case scenario where the impact of Covid-19 on health services is severe, this number could rise to up to 200,000 additional deaths, they said. The most probable scenario, based on the current information and distancing measures, suggests 6,000 additional deaths could occur in China, 95,000 in India and 13,000 in South Africa, according to the researchers. ""There is concern that the Covid-19 pandemic is resulting in decreased TB clinic attendance, delayed diagnosis and treatment,"" said study first author Finn McQuaid, Assistant Professor in Infectious Disease Epidemiology at LSHTM. ""This is especially so in low- and middle-income countries where health services, or access to them, might be substantially disrupted,"" McQuaid said. He noted that early anecdotal information from India, China, and South Africa suggests that the number of people being diagnosed and treated for TB has fallen significantly. The team measured the effect of these factors on TB incidence and deaths in these three countries which make up about 40 per cent of the global TB cases. The researchers modelled different scenarios with various implementations of social distancing measures and health service disruption lasting for six months to estimate the impact of Covid-19 on global TB burden. They found that if there is substantial health service disruption, such as a 50 per cent reduction in TB cases detected and successfully treated, there would be an increase in both incidence and deaths from TB over the subsequent five years, regardless of the level of social contact. However, if social distancing measures are minimal and there is substantial health care disruption -- based on 80 per cent reduction in case detection and treatment success -- the model predicts an 8-14 per cent increase in cumulative deaths from TB over the next five years. ""We need to act now to ensure innovative approaches to people-centric TB care are the focus, so that the fight to end this pandemic does not overwrite the hard-won gains made against this disease,” McQuaid explained. ""Given that health service disruption far outweighs the benefit of social distancing, it is crucial to maintain and strengthen TB-related health services during, and after, Covid-19,"" he said. ",

The researchers, including those from The University of Liverpool in the UK, assessed 153 patients hospitalised during the acute phase of the pandemic, and found that the most common brain complication observed was stroke. They described the range of neurological and psychiatric complications that may be linked to the disease in the study published in the journal The Lancet Psychiatry. ""There have been growing reports of an association between Covid-19 infection and possible neurological or psychiatric complications, but until now these have typically been limited to studies of ten patients or fewer,"" said Benedict Michael, lead-author of the study from The University of Liverpool. In the study, the scientists set up a secure, UK-wide digital network for specialist doctors to report details of specific cases. They said these portals were hosted by professional bodies representing specialists in neurology, stroke, psychiatry, and intensive care. ""This data represents an important snapshot of the brain-related complications of Covid-19 in hospitalised patients. It is critically important that we continue to collect this information to really understand this virus fully,"" said Sarah Pett, co-author of the study from the University College London in the UK. According to Pett, similar studies conducted on a larger scale can help understand the ""frequency of these brain complications, who's most at risk of getting them, and ultimately how best to treat."" The scientists said the most common brain complication observed was stroke, which was reported in 77 of 125 patients. Of these, they said 57 patients had a stroke caused by a blood clot in the brain, known as an ischaemic stroke, nine patients had a stroke caused by a brain haemorrhage, and one patient had a stroke caused by inflammation in the blood vessels of the brain. The researchers said age data was available for 74 of the patients who experienced a stroke, and the majority were over 60 years of age. According to the study, 39 patients showed signs of confusion or changes in behaviour reflecting an altered mental state. Of these, it noted that nine patients had unspecified brain dysfunction, known as encephalopathy, and seven people had inflammation of the brain, medically termed encephalitis. The remaining 23 patients with an altered mental state were diagnosed with psychiatric conditions, of which the vast majority (92 per cent) were determined as new diagnoses by the notifying psychiatrist. These patients with psychiatric diagnoses included ten patients with a new-onset psychosis, and six patients with a dementia-like syndrome, the study noted. According to the researchers, seven patients had signs of a mood disorder, including depression and anxiety. While most of the psychiatric diagnoses were determined as new by the notifying psychiatrist, they said there is also a possibility that these were undiagnosed before the patient developed Covid-19. The researchers speculated that the high proportion of younger patients diagnosed with psychiatric conditions could be because these patients may be more likely to be referred to a psychiatrist or other specialist doctors. Confusion or behaviour changes in older patients may be more likely to be attributed to delirium and not investigated further, they explained. According to the scientists, it is not possible to draw conclusions based on the study about the total proportion of Covid-19 patients likely to be affected by neurological and psychiatric complications. They said detailed long-term studies are needed in order to confirm if there is any link between Covid-19 infection and the onset of psychiatric or neurological complications in younger patients. ",

The study was conducted by researchers of University of Cincinnati College of Medicine and UC Health and was published in the journal Liver Transplantation. Two sets of 32 patients were enrolled in groups: one group receiving livers for transplant from donors testing positive for hepatitis C (HCV) and a second receiving livers for transplant from donors testing negative for the infection. One patient in the experimental group died as a result of factors not related to hepatitis C during transplantation. ""What we found is that you can use hepatitis C infected livers and the results in this interim analysis are the same whether there is a need to treat organs affected by hepatitis C or not. Everyone who received a liver affected by hepatitis C was cleared of the virus,"" said Shimul Shah, MD, professor of surgery in the UC College of Medicine, the James and Catherine Orr Endowed Chair of Liver Transplantation, section chief of transplantation at UC Health and senior author of the study. As part of the clinical trial, 32 patients received HCV-positive livers while a control group of 32 patients, all at University of Cincinnati Medical Center, received non infected livers for transplantation between June 2018 and October 2019. No HCV treatment failures were reported and there were no differences in 30-day and one-year graft (or organ) and patient survival, length of hospital stay, complications or blood infections between the two groups. ""HCV-positive organs can be safely used in patients who do not have the infection, and HCV can be safely eradicated, thereby increasing the chances for the patients to receive vital organ transplants,"" said Nadeem Anwar, a professor in the UC Department of Internal Medicine, a UC Health physician and first author of the scholarly journal. ""There is a big difference between the demand and supply of livers and previously organs affected with hepatitis C were being discarded. With this study it is clear that we can help more patients get transplanted using HCV-positive organs,"" said Anwar. ""With the opioid crisis, unfortunately, there have been more overdose-related deaths and some of these patients do donate organs. Some of these organs may be hep C-positive, but since the donors are young, the livers are still in very good condition and can be used for transplants,"" added Anwar. Nationally, there are 13,000 patients waiting for liver transplants. In 2019, 133 liver transplants were performed at UC Medical Center, said Shah. ""This is the largest study of liver transplantation published in North America. This is the first one published for liver transplant patients proving you can do this safely and that's why we wanted to get it out there,"" said Shah. The median age for individuals receiving a HCV-positive liver in the study was 60, while for the control group the media age was 57. Median donor age was 37. Most of the participants in both groups were white males. Individuals needing treatment for hepatitis C received it 47 days after transplantation. Shah said physicians wanted to make sure there were no complications from the liver transplant and they also needed to wait for insurance companies to cover the cost of hepatitis C medications, which typically consists of a 12-week regimen of an HCV protease inhibitor. ""With the excellent results that we demonstrated in this study, we have made this a standard of care at UC Medical Center to offer these organs to our patients,"" said Anwar.( ",

Researchers, including those from the University of Pennsylvania in the US, said cardiac arrests and heartbeat rhythm disturbances suffered by some patients with COVID-19 are likely triggered by a severe, systemic form of the disease, and are and not the sole consequence of the viral infection.  The findings, published in the Heart Rhythm Journal, differ significantly from early reports which showed a high incidence of arrhythmias among all Covid-19 patients, according to the scientists.  They said the results provide more clarity about the role of the novel coronavirus, SARS-COV-2, and the disease it causes, COVID-19, in the development of arrhythmias, including irregular heart rate, slow heart rhythms, or rapid heart rate that stops by itself within 30 seconds.  ""In order to best protect and treat patients who develop Covid-19, it's critical for us to improve our understanding of how the disease affects various organs and pathways within our body -- including our heart rhythm abnormalities,"" said study senior author Rajat Deo from the University of Pennsylvania.  ""Our findings suggest that non-cardiac causes such as systemic infection, inflammation, and illness are likely to contribute more to the occurrence of cardiac arrest and arrhythmias than damaged or infected heart cells due to the viral infection,"" Deo said.  Earlier studies had suggested that Covid-19 is associated with a high incidence of cardiac arrhythmias, particularly among critically ill patients with early reports indicating that 44 per cent of patients admitted to the ICU suffered heartbeat rhythm disturbances.  According to the researchers, heart rhythm problems occur when electrical impulses that coordinate heartbeats don't work properly, causing the heart to beat too fast, too slow, or irregularly.  If left untreated, they said cardiac arrhythmias can lead to serious medical conditions, including stroke and cardiac arrest -- the abrupt loss of heart function.  In the study, the scientists evaluated the risk and incidence of cardiac arrest and arrhythmias among 700 hospitalised patients with Covid-19.  They assessed the clinical records for patient demographics, and medical comorbidities such as heart disease, diabetes and chronic kidney disease, and recorded patient vitals, test results, and treatment.  According to the study, the patients had a mean age of 50 years.  The researchers identified a total of 53 arrhythmic events -- nine patients who suffered cardiac arrest, 25 patients with atrial fibrillation who required treatment, nine patients with clinically significant slow heart rhythms, and 10 people who had rapid heart rate that stopped by itself within 30 seconds.  Of the 700 patients hospitalised, they said about 11 per cent were admitted to the ICU.  None of the other hospitalised patients suffered a cardiac arrest, the study noted.  On controlling for underlying demographic and clinical factors, the scientists found that cardiac arrest and arrhythmias were more likely to occur among patients in an ICU compared to the other hospitalised patients.  Citing the limitations of the study, they said the analysis was conducted from a single centre serving a large urban population.  ""More research is needed to assess whether the presence of cardiac arrhythmias have long-term health effects on patients who were hospitalised for Covid-19,"" Deo said. ",

Know the truth,"It is a popular belief that women are not allowed to chant Vedas. In Hinduism, women are considered as a symbol of prakruthi (nature) then how can this religion bar women from chanting Veda mantras. In fact, there is nothing mentioned in the Vedas that points towards the prohibition of women from learning Vedas. People have misconceptions that reciting Vedas mantras would affect the childbearing capacity of a woman. Neither do the Vedas nor Hinduism discriminate against women. In Hindu scripture Tandya Brahmana there are some mantras which can only be recited by women. Women have the highest esteem in the Sanatana dharma. It is said that women created the Trimurtis (Brahma, Vishnu, and Mahesh) and then Trimurtis created the universe. It is also a misconception that women are not allowed to recite Sundara Kanda as it contains the Gayatri Mantra. But many researchers believe that in no way did the ancient people discriminate against women to recite Vedas. In fact, the Vedas say that a The Atharva Veda is a Hindu scripture entirely written on domestic rituals. It is attributed to a woman sage named Rishika Vagambhrina. In ancient India, girls graduating from Gurukul had two choices - either they can become Brahmavadinis or they can get married. Brahmavadinis are the girls who dedicated their life to studying Vedas. These women sometimes remained unmarried for their whole life. However, Brahmavadinis were not entirely barred from getting married. There are many examples in modern India where women recite and study Vedas. In February 2019, a group of 121 ladies chanted and recited Vedas for 2 hours without break as part of Maha Rudrabhiskeham in Srikakulam, Andhra Pradesh. This was the first time in history that 121 women recited Vedas without break for 2 hours. This event bagged 5 world records. This was an attempt to prove that chanting Vedas by women is not wrong.

The World Meteorological Organization said Tuesday that it's looking to verify the temperature reading on Saturday in the Russian town of Verkoyansk with Roshydromet, the Russian federal service for hydro-meteorological and environmental monitoring. Agency spokeswoman Clare Nullis said wildfires in the Russian region and hot summer conditions regularly drive temperatures above 30 degrees C (86 F) in July, but they've never been found to top 38 degrees in the area. ``We're taking it seriously, but we need to await official confirmation,'' she told reporters in Geneva.

The new plates, which will carry a bright green stripe down one side, will help authorities identify electric vehicles, making it easier for their drivers to access incentives such as cheaper parking and exemptions from emissions charges. Transport Secretary Grant Shapps said the initiative would raise awareness of cleaner vehicles and show Britons ""a greener transport future is within our grasp"". ""A green recovery is key to helping us achieve our net-zero carbon commitments while also promoting economic growth,"" he said in a statement. Additionally, the government has allocated 12 million pounds ($15.17 million) to fund research into zero-emission technology, including developing greener vehicles and improving existing car battery charging technology. Tuesday's announcement follows a public consultation in October as part of the government's 1.5 billion pound ""Road to Zero"" strategy to slash emissions from road transport. Only zero-emission vehicles will be eligible to receive the new registration plates. Leading automotive services company RAC Ltd said the move alone was unlikely to spur real change in consumer behaviour and called for further financial incentives to encourage drivers to make the switch. ""We'd like to see more direct financial incentives to bring the cost of EVs (electric vehicles) down, as drivers tell us it's the cost that's one of the biggest barriers to them opting for an EV,"" RAC spokesman Rod Dennis said. The Telegraph reported last week that Prime Minister Boris Johnson was considering giving drivers up to 6,000 pounds to swap their diesel and petrol cars for electric vehicles. Edmund King, president of British motoring association AA Plc, said the distinctive licence plates could instil a sense of pride among drivers, adding that more than a third of AA members backed the initiative. ""Having a green flash on the number plate may become a badge of honour for some drivers,"" he said in a statement. ",

""For reasons related to our competitiveness but above all to reach our ambitious climate goals"", ministers have agreed to pump nine billion euros ($10.2 billion) of government cash into the technology, Economy Minister Peter Altmaier told reporters in Berlin. Seven billion euros will go on supporting hydrogen's entry into the market in Germany, while a further two billion euros are earmarked for ""international partnerships"", Altmaier added. Green hydrogen is seen by Berlin as a key link in the chain between renewable energy generation and end users, allowing easy storage and transport of power generated from the sun or wind. So-called ""green"" hydrogen is produced by electrolysis -- using renewable electricity to split water into hydrogen and oxygen -- rather than being obtained from fossil sources, as the gas historically has been. Possible applications for the new fuel include production of climate-neutral steel, storage of energy for the winter, or powering road vehicles as an alternative to battery-electric drive, Altmaier said By 2030, Germany aims to build five gigawatts of hydrogen-producing capacity nationwide, rising to 10 gigawatts by 2040 at the latest. Ministers also hope to export the technology and know-how to produce green hydrogen to other countries Supporting fossil fuel-exporting nations and developing countries in building up hydrogen production ""means new markets for German builders of industrial plants"", which would in turn feed Germany with amounts of the fuel it cannot produce at home, Altmaier said. ""The 'Made in Germany' seal of quality should be stamped on green hydrogen technology,"" agreed Research Minister Anja Karliczek. The hydrogen strategy presented Wednesday is a part of Berlin's 130-billion-euro recovery plan to boost Europe's top economy as it emerges from the coronavirus crisis. ""With the launch of its hydrogen strategy in the midst of economic recovery debates, Germany shows that long-term investments in zero carbon technologies are a necessary part of the crisis response,"" said Claudia Kemfert of Berlin think-tank DIW. In steelmaking, producer Thyssenkrupp announced Wednesday a partnership with energy firm RWE to use green hydrogen in a test furnace. The gas would replace coke and pulverised coal as a ""reducing agent"" to remove oxygen from iron ore, producing water rather than climate changing carbon dioxide. Set to come online in the mid-2020s, the first unit will produce ""climate-neutral steel sufficient to build 50,000 cars"", said Thyssenkrupp steel chief Bernhard Osburg. ""You can't achieve a comparable climate protection effect with green hydrogen anywhere else"" than steel, he added. Thyssenkrupp plans to make all its steel output climate-neutral by 2050. ""All steel industry bosses recognise that in the long term, we only have a chance of producing climate-neutral steel in Germany... with green hydrogen,"" minister Altmaier said. Some observers warned that the government was lining up too broad a swathe of target industries as potential clients for green hydrogen. Berlin hopes to use the fuel in the car industry, as foreign firms like Tesla or China's CATL have stolen a march on the likes of BMW and Volkswagen in batteries -- where most of the added value in electric vehicles is concentrated. ""Green hydrogen will be a scarce resource,"" said energy and climate expert Constantin Zerger of Germany's DUH environmental NGO. ""It should not be used in sectors that have alternatives for decarbonisation at hand. This goes for cars and heating in buildings in particular."" ",

White House Deputy Press Secretary Sarah Matthews made the comments while responding to a question on a recent survey results that Indian-Americans, who traditionally vote for the Democratic Party, are switching towards Trump, a Republican, in the November 3 election. Trump is seeking re-election to the White House in the November 3 presidential elections. “President Trump is incredibly grateful for the widespread support he has received from the people of India and from millions of Indian-Americans across the United States,” Matthews told PTI. According to the survey results conducted by Al Mason, co-chair of the Trump Victory Indian-American Finance Committee, more than 50 per cent of Indian-Americans in the battle ground states of Michigan, Florida, Texas, Pennsylvania and Virginia are crossing over to support Trump. During his more than three and half years of his presidency, Trump has made an extra effort to reach out to the Indian-American community. His close relationship with Prime Minister Narendra Modi – reflected in the two leaders jointly addressing massive public rallies in Houston and Ahmedabad – has helped him make deep inroads among the Indian-Americans. “He (Trump) recognises the vital role Indian-Americans play in bolstering our economy, enriching our culture, and strengthening our communities,” she said. During his first two years in office, President Trump led the US to its greatest economic comeback in history. “And the unemployment rate among Indian-Americans dropped by nearly 33 per cent,” Matthews said. The President continues to fight for the prosperity, health, and freedom of all Americans, including the flourishing and hardworking Indian-American community, she said, responding to a question related to the increasing popularity of Trump among the community. Al Mason said while the vision of Trump is the driving force in this unprecedented outreach with the Indian-Americans and a new peak in ties with India, the entire family including the First Lady Melania Trump, Ivanka Trump and Jared Kushner, who have recently visited India with him, shown their immense respect and love for the country. Not to overlook son Donald Trump Jr and Kimberly Guilfoyle, senior advisor to Donald Trump for President, Inc. and national chair of the Trump Victory Finance Committee, Mason said. Former TV host-cum-attorney Guilfoyle is now considered as one of the most powerful individuals in the Trump campaign. Both Trump Jr and Guilfoyle have time and again echoed Trump's love for India and Indian-Americans which is reflected in their remarks at various Indian-American events in New York. ""Want to see America work with incredible allies like India to make the world a safer place,” Don Jr said last year. ""America embodies family values, values of hardworking people, strong work ethic, entrepreneurial spirit and these values are ""shared magnificently with India as well,” said Guilfoyle, who believes that Indian-Americans are a crucial ally for the campaign. ""I think we're so lucky as a country to have so many talented, dedicated, patriotic Indian-Americans making up the incredibly diverse fabric culturally of this country and we're lucky that they have called it their home,” Guilfoyle, who has helped initiate the process, said.

Tejaswini Ganti, anthropology professor at New York University who has studied the industry’s workings in her book ‘Producing Bollywood’, gives Amulya Gopalakrishnan her perspective Why is Bollywood seen as hostile to outsiders?The personalised and hereditary nature of the Hindi film industry obviously creates barriers for those who have no family or social connections. The absence of any defined method to gain access makes the process of trying to “get a break” that much more haphazard. When outsiders do manage to succeed, their stories, which are anomalies, are touted as the norm. But I’m struck by how the epithet “nepotism” is lobbed most vehemently at Bollywood when pretty much every field in India could be described that way. The family firm continues to thrive in India. Filmmaking has also been structured as a family business in India — relying on personal networks is a way of hedging risk in an uncertain environment. This also seems to mirror folk and classical performance traditions like music and dance, which historically have been hereditary vocations. However, no one gets upset when a classical musician’s children become musicians. Has inherited advantage always been the norm in the film industry?For much of its history, filmmaking was not a hereditary occupation in India. With the exception of the Kapoors, the pioneers of the Hindi film industry did not establish filmmaking lineages or dynasties. It began to seem like a hereditary vocation in the early 1980s with the phenomenon of “star sons” — Sanjay Dutt, Kumar Gaurav, Sunny Deol — making their debuts in films produced by their fathers. This trend intensified from the mid-1990s, and by 2008 a little over 60% of the actors who appeared in leading roles hailed from film families. Of the top ten male stars in the industry, eight were either second- or third-generation members of the film industry. When I started doing this research in 1996, nearly everyone I met had entered the industry through a family or friendship. Even then, it seemed as if the Hindi film industry was literally reproducing itself in all spheres: production, distribution, and exhibition. Why would that happen, at a time when liberalisation should have widened opportunities?It is not so surprising that kinship networks intensified in the Hindi film industry from the mid-1990s, after liberalisation. The family becomes even more economically essential under capitalist expansion. Many businesses become hereditary when there is something to inherit, and economic security comes from consolidating one’s investment within the family. A consequence of the greater economic potential and cultural legitimacy of Hindi cinema since the mid-1990s was its increasing attractiveness as a career for filmmakers’ own children. Why has this situation caused so much more heartburn in the last few years? I think that the increased number of people from middle to upper-middle class backgrounds trying to enter the industry has played a role. Given that there is no longer a stigma attached to working in the film industry, people who are also college-educated or trained in film institutes and have been socialised into a notion of “merit”, become frustrated with the lack of access. Also, all the discussion about the “corporatisation” of Bollywood suggests transparent practices of hiring and advancement. And yet, this intensely personalised nature of work and reliance on family and friends seems to be the opposite of that. With the explosion of TV channels and social media, people have more venues to vent their criticism. What difference does social background make to an actor’s work experience?Women without family or social connections have more chances at a film career than men, through routes such as beauty pageants, modelling, or being “discovered” by star-makers. Ironically, the patriarchal nature of the film industry enables unconnected women to gain entry because the success or failure of a film is not perceived to be dependent upon the lead actress. Industry offspring have access to social networks and specialised knowledge of the workings of the film industry. This form of training by immersion and instant name-recognition is interpreted by producers and distributors as a type of guarantee in a very uncertain business. Because they are already celebrities before even starting their careers, they can be interpreted as “brands”. Other factors that can give people an advantage is being from Mumbai, living in the western suburbs, and being fluent in English. Knowing Hindi is actually much less important, ironically. Has the background of those who work in the film industry diversified in recent years? It really depends on which metric one is using and which part of the industry one is describing. The Hindi film industry has high levels of regional, ethnic, religious and linguistic diversity. Compared to the rest of Indian society, there is a high rate of inter-marriage across these lines. However, when one looks at actors, directors, producers, writers, and other creative or financial decision-makers, they are still largely upper-caste/savarna. ",Amulya Gopalakrishnan

The man identified as Nidhan Singh, hails from Tsamkani district in the Paktika province and was employed as a Gurusewak (helper) at the local Gurudwara. Post Singh's abduction, the Afghan Sikh community living in the United States has again urged the Government of India to help in the resettlement of the Sikhs living in Afghanistan . They have appealed to India to make special arrangements under Vande Bharat Mission to provide a safe haven for over 600 Sikhs. ""I have spoken to Sikh Member of Parliament Narinder Singh and he confirmed that officials in the Afghan Government have promised to help and find Nidhan,"" Paramjit Singh Bedi, chairman of the Afghan Sikh community in New Jersey told ANI. ""Narinder Singh has also reached out to the Taliban leaders and has been assured that all efforts will be made to ensure his release,"" Bedi further said.

Worried for the lives of the Sikh minorities living in Kabul, Jalalabad and Ghazni, the Sikh community has been constantly seeking support from India. Encouraged by the steps taken in the past by the Indian government, leaders of the Afghan Sikh community have made several appeals to India to accommodate the Sikhs and Hindus from Afghanistan and grant them legal entry with long term residency multiple entry visa. The community leaders living in the United States said it is imperative to alleviate the dire situation of religious minorities in Afghanistan who look to India as the only safe haven in the region. In May this year, expressing concerns over the safety and security of religious minorities in Afghanistan, twenty-six US Congressmen urged Secretary of State, Mike Pompeo, to take all available steps to facilitate the ""safe and expeditious relocation"" of members of the Sikh and Hindu communities trapped in the war-hit country.

Juneteenth celebrates the emancipation of those who had been enslaved in the US. Indiana-based Khalsa, a recipient of the prestigious Rosa Parks Trailblazer Award, also said that we need to portray the true picture of America if we want to replace hate and violence with love and compassion. Khalsa, who is also the founder of SikhsPAC, a nonpartisan political action committee, said that his USD 1 million worth donation of face masks and protective shields to the protestors nationwide is a small token of contribution to those who are seeking justice and end to the police brutality, reflected in the recent gruesome murder of 46-year-old Floyd in Minneapolis last month. Khalsa recently started Cleanxa, a personal protection equipment manufacturer and distributor, which would be used to distribute reusable, rewash able, medical grade filtered face masks and protective shields to protestors either individually or in bulk through non-profit bodies. Noting that he took this decision to commemorate Juneteenth to support national movement seeking police reforms, Khalsa requests every American to join this movement by following the path of peaceful protest shown by leaders like Martin Luther King Jr and Mahatma Gandhi. ""Going forward if we want to replace hate and violence with love and compassion, we need to portray the true picture of American history. This is the most important part of American history, which is not being taught in schools. For the better future of America, we need to learn our lessons from history, however bitter it might be,"" he said. Observing that he was inspired by two movies that he recently watched “Just Mercy” and “13th” and the series “Hell on Wheels”, Khalsa said that people of this great country still have a long way to go to achieve the goals of equality and equity set up by its founding fathers. Amidst the COVID-19 pandemic in the country, widespread protests have been taking place for weeks across the US following the death of Floyd in Minneapolis while he was in police custody. Protesters have sparred with police for weeks. The US continues to remain the worst-hit country from the novel coronavirus with 2,191,052 cases and 118,434 deaths. ""SikhsPAC has always and will always stand with the Black community. SikhsPAC is making these donations as a way to advocate for police reform and justice for Black individuals in the United States. Along with this, SikhsPAC would like these donations to reflect their support for making Juneteenth a national holiday,"" Khalsa said. ""In this country, the atrocities against Black individuals are not covered enough within the history lessons taught to our children in schools,"" he rued. ""Putting a blanket over the history of systematic racism in our country is one of the most harmful things we can do – the new generations moving forward will be much more passionate, caring, and understanding towards their Black community members if they are taught the real, tough history,"" Khalsa said.

Kshama Sawant, the Seattle City Councilwoman, is encouraging activists in the CHAZ ""to hold out on giving back the precinct to cops or allowing officers inside the barricaded region"", according to Fox News. Widespread protests have been taking place for weeks across the US following the death of 46-year-old African American George Floyd in Minneapolis while he was in police custody. Protesters have sparred with police for weeks. Pune-born Sawant urged protesters to hold strong to the six-block region they've designated a ""no cop"" zone, the report said. Sawant has said she will introduce legislation to convert the precinct into ""a community center for restorative justice."" ""Our movement needs to urgently ensure East Precinct is not handed back to police, but is turned over permanently into community control. My office is bringing legislation to convert East Precinct into a community center for restorative justice,"" she tweeted on Friday. On Tuesday, she also participated in demonstrations calling to defund the police and allowed over a thousand demonstrators into City Hall in a late-night protest calling for Mayor Jenny Durkan to resign. She said she did it to show City Hall belongs to the people and she wanted the diverse group of demonstrators to be heard in the halls of power, Komonews.com reported. More than 1,000 protesters spent an hour talking about defunding the Seattle Police Department, banning chemical weapon use by police, and railing on Mayor Jenny Durkan, demanding she step down immediately, the report said. Even though social distancing was non-existent, everyone wore masks and the evening remained peaceful. Assistant Police Chief Deanna Nollette also says no laws were broken, so officers did not respond, it added. Born to Vasundhara and H T Ramanujam in 1973, Sawant grew up in Mumbai where she later studied computer science and graduated with a BS from the University of Mumbai in 1994. Sawant married and moved to the United States. After moving to the United States Sawant decided to abandon the computer engineering field.

In her message during a virtual commencement address, the 39-year-old Congresswoman from Hawaii said that it is a chaotic time and no one can say with certainty what tomorrow looks like. “… but we find certainty, strength and peace in the practice of Bhakti Yoga and Karma Yoga taught to us by Krishna in the Bhagavad Gita,” Gabbard told the ‘Class of 2020 for Hindu students'. Her address came amidst protests in the US against the killing of African-American George Floyd by a white police officer in Minneapolis. The country has been swept by protests since Floyd's custodial death on May 25 with thousands of people mounting pressure for changes to the law enforcement practices. The first-ever virtual Hindu commencement was organised by the Hindu Students Council on June 7, which drew thousands of viewers on Facebook and YouTube Live, all coming together in solidarity during the ongoing COVID-19 crisis. According to Johns Hopkins Coronavirus Resource Center, the contagion has infected over 76,00,000 people and killed more than 4,25,000 across the world. The US is the worst affected country with over 2.04 million cases and more than 1,14,000 deaths. The COVID-19, which originated in China's Wuhan city in December last year, has also battered the world economy with the International Monetary Fund saying that the global economy is bound to suffer a ""severe recession"". Scientists are racing against time to find a vaccine or medicine for its treatment. Hundreds of graduates from the US, Canada, the UK, India and Australia attended to commemorate their graduation in a unique way - by celebrating their shared Hindu values. Professor Subhash Kak served as the ceremony's Grand Marshall. “As you think about this new chapter in your lives, ask yourself what is my purpose in life? It is a deep question that if you can recognise now that your purpose is to serve God and God's children, practicing Karma Yoga, then you can lead a truly successful life,” Gabbard said. “Success is not defined by temporary material things, trinkets, glittery objects or accomplishments - but a deeply successful and happy life centered around service,” she added. The Iraq war veteran ended her presidential campaign in March and offered her full support to former vice president Joe Biden, 77, who is all set to challenge Republican incumbent Donald Trump, 73, in November elections. The commencement address focused heavily on themes from the Bhagavad Gita, a timeless historical text that many Hindus consider their moral framework. Professor Kak, Regent Professor at Oklahoma State University and 2019 Padma Shri recipient, read out the names of the graduating students. “I exhort you - the graduating students - to be the leaders of the new world where education is less of the mind of a vessel to be filled with information (usually forgotten after the semester is over), and more of a flame that is lit as envisioned by our Vedic sages,” he said. The student speakers were from many university campuses, including the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Princeton and Stanford. The programme included offerings of Hindu prayers, recitation of a traditional graduation message from the Upanishads and a symbolic conferral of degrees to high school and college graduate. Founded in 1990, Hindu Students Council is North America's largest pan-Hindu youth organisation. ",

Dr Nishant Joshi and his pregnant wife, Dr Meenal Viz, had initiated the legal action in April with a pre-action letter seeking answers from the UK's Department of Health and Social Care and Public Health England. They decided to push ahead with the case in the High Court in London on Wednesday because they feel they are “no longer willing to wait”. “We don't want to be doing this. We didn't plan on doing this. We're doctors in a pandemic. We want to focus on saving lives and stitching this country back together,” the couple said in a statement. “But we have been pushed into taking action by the government's refusal to address the issues we have raised,” they said. Their law firm, Bindmans, said the judicial review challenge highlights the “mismatch” between the government's guidance on PPE and the guidance set out by the World Health Organisation (WHO), including in respect of when “full” PPE is required, as well as with respect to the reuse and reprocessing of PPE – which includes items such surgical gowns, face visors and gloves. The doctors' case claims that the government's guidance also fails properly to warn healthcare and social care workers of the risks they face with different levels of PPE and their legal rights to refuse to work when inadequate PPE is available. “As frontline doctors, Dr Viz and Dr Joshi understand the operational pressures faced by government better than most, but they, along with all other health and social care workers, remain entitled to lawful and transparent guidance on the use of PPE and the risks they are facing on the frontline of responding to this national crisis,” said Jamie Potter, Partner at Bindmans LLP and solicitor for Dr Viz and Dr Joshi. “Accordingly, we have today [Wednesday] filed judicial review proceedings seeking to challenge that guidance with a view to bringing into line with WHO guidance as well as human rights legislation. This is important not just in the current crisis, but also to any ‘second spike' or future pandemic,” he said. The couple highlight that a disproportionate number of the Covid-19 victims are from ethnic minority backgrounds, and the challenge also raises the government's failure properly to consider the impact on black, Asian and minority ethnic (BAME) health and social care workers across the state-funded National Health Service (NHS). “The government have also refused to allow Dr Viz and Dr Joshi to publish their initial responses to the pre-action correspondence so that others can assess the adequacy of their approach to PPE. Our clients will push in any proceedings to ensure such documents are made public,” their law firm said. The couple's online crowdfunding initiative for the legal case has raised over 61,000 pounds in pledges. Viz, who is eight months pregnant, has also been leading protests outside Downing Street and last month she and her colleagues observed a 237-second silence – one second for every healthcare worker who died in the line of duty during this pandemic in the UK. The Department of Health said it cannot comment on “ongoing legal proceedings” but has in the past stressed that safety factors have been taken into account with its guidance. ",

The Indian-American Impact Fund cited the killings of unarmed African-American George Floyd by a white police officer in Minneapolis on May 25 and 26-year-old African-American woman Breonna Taylor by Louisville Metro Police Department officers on March 13, and said: “Let us be clear: our community is not guiltless”. “For far too long, far too many Indian-Americans and South Asian-Americans have been, at best, silent and at worst, complicit,” it said in a statement on Friday. The US-based advocacy group, which helps Indian-Americans join politics and run for elected offices, has observed that the recent killings of Floyd, Taylor and others have exposed the horrifying reality of anti-blackness in America. “Many of us are here because of the tireless work of black and civil rights activists to open up immigration to America, and many more of us have benefited from the ‘myth of the model minority'. “And yet, we have begged off hard conversations about race and racism with our friends and family,” it said. That can and must change, the group said. “And while we have important work to do, there are reasons to be hopeful,” it said. Consider Gandhi Mahal, a Minneapolis Indian restaurant owned by Bangladeshi immigrants that offered space to medics and protestors in the aftermath of George Floyd's murder, it said. “The New York Times tells us that Ruhel Islam, the owner of the restaurant, prepared daal (lentil), basmati rice and naan (Indian bread) -- comfort food we all know so well -- for protestors. And when his restaurant was burned during the protests, Ruhel said ‘let my building burn. Justice needs to be served'. And consider Rahul Dubey, a Washington DC businessman, who opened his home in the dead of the night to over 70 peaceful protestors seeking refuge from police deploying tear gas and flash bangs, it said. “Our community knows well the spirit of hospitality and generosity. In Rahul's words, ‘right now I'm going to take joy that 70 people came into my life that are fierce, and that are dedicated… I hope they get back out there and stay in touch,” the group said. Asserting that ‘Black Lives Matter', the group said that the community must support and work alongside black communities in the struggle to dismantle systems that perpetuate discrimination, disenfranchisement and racial violence - the kind of hate violence they too have experienced. “We commit to using our platform to spread awareness and educate on issues of racial justice, and continue supporting candidates who share this vision,” the group added.

Sharma, 52, was seen feeling uneasy and sweating during a debate on the Corporate Insolvency and Governance Bill in Parliament on Wednesday. “Alok Sharma began feeling unwell when in the Chamber delivering the second reading of the Corporate Insolvency and Governance Bill,” a spokesperson for the minister said. “In line with guidance he has been tested for coronavirus and is returning home to self isolate,” the spokesperson said. Shadow business secretary, Labour's Ed Miliband, was seen passing the minister a glass of water as he looked visibly unwell. If Sharma tests positive for the coronavirus, anyone in his proximity within two metres for more than 15 minutes would have to self isolate for two weeks as per the current UK government guidelines. As a senior member of the Cabinet who has been a regular at all meetings, his illness will raise concerns over the impact a positive test would have within the top rung of the government. The minister was among hundreds of MPs seen queuing for hours on Tuesday to cast their votes under new social distance rules as Parliament returned to a physical setting after a hybrid version, which involved remote attendance by MPs via screens set up in the chamber. Sharma's illness will renew concerns expressed by several MPs over the return of physical voting after digital voting was discontinued. While only a limited number of MPs are allowed to sit within the Commons chamber at any given point, Leader of the Commons Jacob Rees-Mogg had stipulated the return of all parliamentarians to the Palace of Westminster in central London. He has faced backlash from all sides of the House over the decision to abandon digital voting options, including from MPs with health conditions who are unable to participate in proceedings. Lisa Nandy, Labour's Indian-origin shadow foreign secretary, was among those who expressed concern following Sharma's illness. “The government stopped MPs from working from home and asked us to return to a building where social distancing is impossible. MPs are travelling home to every part of the country tonight. Reckless doesn't even begin to describe it.” Many of the MPs had posted images on social media of the long snaking queue across the Parliament complex on Tuesday as they lined up to cast their vote while trying to maintain the requisite two-metre distance to prevent the transmission of the deadly virus. A House of Commons spokesperson said: “The House's priority is to ensure that those on the estate are safe while business is facilitated. “We have closely followed guidance from PHE (Public Health England) on action to take following a suspected case of Covid on site, including additional cleaning. Our risk assessment outlines the measures we have already put in place to reduce the risk of transmission in Parliament."" ",

Chandrabali Datta, who was born in Kolkata, works in the Clinical Biomanufacturing Facility at the University's Jenner Institute where Phase II and III of human trials of the vaccine named ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 are being conducted as a possible tool to fight the deadly virus. The 34-year-old's role as a quality assurance manager means it is her task to ensure all levels of compliance are met before the vaccine could progress to the trial stage. ""We are all hoping that it works in the next stage; the whole world is looking to this vaccine,"" said Datta. ""It's like a humanitarian cause to be a part of this project. We are a non-profit organisation, putting in extra hours everyday just to make this vaccine successful, so that human lives can be saved. It is a massive team effort and everyone has worked around the clock towards its success. I feel honoured to be a part of this project,"" she said. While her own ""close knit"" team of 25 experts on the production side of the vaccine is extremely gender balanced, Datta is keen to encourage young girls in India to challenge a perceived male dominance in the field of bioscience. ""If you are motivated and up for a challenge, then this is your field. Nowadays, biotech and pharma are getting an equal male-female ratio so there are lots of opportunities,"" she said. ""The scientific field is not highly paid, so you have to get rid of your materialistic desires if you want to be successful in this field. But if your motivation is really high and you are up for the struggle, then this is a very rewarding area of work. There is lots of recognition for your hard work because at the end of the day you are improving human lives,"" she says, as a message for young girls considering a career in bioscience. Datta, who studied engineering and biotechnology in Kolkata, was drawn to biology and mathematics in childhood. She went on to study computer science and even worked as an associate software engineer with Accenture in India but was pulled back to biotech because of its ""evolving and inventive"" potential. ""My childhood friend was studying in Nottingham, who inspired me, and the UK is known for equal rights, women rights. So, I chose to do my Masters in biotech from the University of Leeds,"" she recalls. ""It has been a real struggle – leaving India and coming here. My mother wasn't too happy about her only child moving countries to study. But my father has always been ambitious for me and said I should chase my dreams and not compromise,"" she said. During this time, Datta balanced shifts at the supermarket and pizza restaurants with her laboratory experiments in order to cover living costs. After her degree, came more hardships in the form of a job hunt, which proved extremely challenging and involved drafting hundreds of applications a day. She recalls, ""I remember I would finish my lab project and quickly run to Tesco to do evening shifts from 6.30pm to midnight. And, by the time I would get home, I didn't even have time to eat, I would just fall asleep. I would sleep only three hours a day."" ""Getting a job wasn't easy without industry experience. Many of my peers went the PhD route but I wanted to be in the industry. A lot of my friends gave up and returned to India. But I refused to give up,"" she said. Her persistence paid off when she got a job at pharmaceutical giant GlaxoSmithKline as an R&D scientist developing inhalers. Her hard work and diligence saw her move up the ranks quickly until her current job at Oxford University about a year ago, where she finds herself a part of one of the world's most-talked-about vaccine projects. ""I have to make sure that all our departments are compliant, everyone is trained in whatever they are doing and following all standard operating procedures (SOPs). Particularly in this project, my contribution was to check that everything is compliant, SOPs are followed, no mistakes were made,"" she explains. But working through the lockdown as a key worker on the frontlines of the pandemic meant her parents back in Kolkata being constantly worried for her safety. ""My parents were really worried and paranoid about me going in to work during this crisis. But I had to help my team. Everyone is under stress, given the pandemic, and we supported each other through this crisis period. Whenever someone was struggling, there were people around to help,"" she said. While she manages to stay in touch with family and friends back in India through regular WhatsApp calls, Datta is hoping she can be with her parents for her annual Christmas trip by the end of the year. ""We have never seen a pandemic like this in our lives. We used to read in history but never imagined that in the 21st century we will actually see such a pandemic which will mean we have to be locked in our houses for months. The main focus is to bring human life back to normal and to save lives,"" she said. ",

Dr Meenal Viz, who is eight months pregnant, was joined by a group of medics dressed in scrubs and face masks at the “Doctors, not Martyrs” protest on Thursday evening, where they stared down the armed police on guard outside UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson's office. The protest coincided with the weekly “clap for carers” initiative, held every Thursday at 8 pm local UK time to honour key workers on the frontline of the pandemic fightback. Johnson also stepped out of his No. 10 Downing Street door to mark the 10th week of the initiative to honour National Health Service (NHS) workers and carers in the wider community. ""I want to thank each and every one of our wonderful NHS and care workers for the incredible, selfless work they do to look after us all,"" he wrote on Twitter. Just a few steps away, the small group of protesters staged their socially distanced silent protest. “As a doctor, I've appreciated your support during #ClapFor Carers. But instead of clapping, I'll observe silence in remembrance of my 237 colleagues who have died during the pandemic,” said Viz. “The government love to talk. This was our show of pure silence to cut through that,” she said. Viz, along with her doctor husband Nishant Joshi, are in the process of seeking a judicial review in the High Court in London after receiving what they believe are “unconvincing” responses from the government over “risky” guidance issued on the use of life-saving PPE, such as surgical gowns. The legal challenge against the guidance, which applies to healthcare and social care workers, claims that it reduces the requirement to wear PPE and allows for re-use of some PPE. It is argued that this goes against World Health Organisation (WHO) guidance and puts healthcare workers at risk, breaching their legal protections at work and their human rights. PPE covers equipment such as surgical masks, gloves, aprons, gowns, goggles and full-face visors required based on the levels of exposure to infection among healthcare professionals. “This case is about protecting frontline health and social care workers and ensuring they have the minimal protections they need to work as safely as possible. In the face of what the government itself calls 'acute shortages' of PPE, there remain some baseline protections which the government must respect,” Estelle Dehon, a barrister representing the couple. “The WHO guidelines are designed to maintain those protections despite acute shortages of PPE and the Government has not explained why it has taken a different approach that causes greater risk for frontline staff,"" she said. The couple said they had asked “simple questions” in a pre-action legal letter and had hoped for an open dialogue and swift resolution with UK Health Secretary Matt Hancock. ""Dr Viz and Dr Joshi cannot wait any longer, given the urgent need to protect health care workers, their families and ultimately their patients,” said Jamie Potter, Partner at Bindmans LLP and their solicitor. The Department of Health has not commented on the legal challenge directly but has previously stressed that measures are in place to minimise risk. Earlier this week addressing a daily Downing Street briefing, Hancock said that “significant progress” had been made on issues surrounding PPE. “While we continue to improve the logistics and work hard to get everyone, the PPE that they need these new supplies mean that we're not simply keeping up with demand, we are now able to begin to replenish our stockpiles,” the health minister said. “There is a lot further to go on PPE, as on so many things, but we have made significant progress, and I'd like to thank everybody involved. PPE of course is so important, because it's about protecting the people who protect us. And we'll do that for as long as the virus remains on these shores,” he said. ",

Shakti Gupta, 34, from Birmingham and Baldev Singh Sahota, 54, from Oldbury in West Midlands were jailed for 18 years and 16 years respectively following a haul of 172 kg of cocaine, one of the largest land seizures of Class A or illegal drugs in the country. ""This operation has resulted in one of the largest land seizures of cocaine within the UK, ever,"" said detective superintendent Neil Ballard, from the metropolitan police specialist crime command. ""It is an extremely significant amount of Class A drugs that indicates the scale of this organised drug supply, which the Met has successfully dismantled,"" he said. On December 11 last year, a team of the Met's specialist crime officers, supported by West Midlands police, carried out a stop of a vehicle on the A45 highway, which was being driven by Sahota. On inspection of the van, officers discovered a large quantity of Class A drugs (cocaine) had been mixed among pallets of frozen food. The total weight of the cocaine discovered was 168 kg. A further search was carried out at an address in Olds Trading Estate Park in Hockley, Birmingham, the same day. A further 4 kg of Class A drugs (cocaine and MDMA) and 1 kg of cutting agent were discovered inside the address. Gupta was arrested following the second raid and both men were taken into custody within the West Midlands police jurisdiction. They were charged with conspiracy to supply Class A drugs, namely cocaine and appeared at Birmingham Crown Court in January this year, where they pleaded guilty to the offence. The duo were sentenced at the same court earlier this month. ""This sentencing result is due to the hard work and commitment from those involved in dismantling drugs networks that are intrinsically linked to the violence that we have seen playing out on our streets throughout the country,"" said Ballard. ""This result should serve as a stark warning to anyone involved in the supply of drugs in London and the rest of the UK that we will do everything we legitimately can to bring you to justice,"" he said. ""The Met will continue to work with, and assist, our colleagues in other forces around the country, who are all dedicated to removing the drugs from our streets and reducing the serious violence associated with drugs supply, to protect the public,"" he added. The Met police released the details of the case this week as part of an appeal for information on anyone suspected of similar criminal activity. ",

The talks took place at a meeting point in Chushul sector on the Indian side of the Line of Actual Control (LAC) in eastern Ladakh, they said. In the previous two rounds of talks, the Indian side pitched for restoration of status quo ante and immediate withdrawal of Chinese troops from Galwan Valley, Pangong Tso and a number of other areas. The Indian and Chinese armies are locked in a bitter standoff in multiple locations in eastern Ladakh for the last seven weeks, and the tension escalated manifold after 20 Indian soldiers were killed in a violent clash in Galwan Valley on June 15. The Chinese side also suffered casualties but it is yet to give out the details. In the talks on June 22, the two sides arrived at a ""mutual consensus"" to ""disengage"" from all the friction points in eastern Ladakh. The previous two rounds of dialogue took place at Moldo on the Chinese side of the LAC. The Indian delegation at the meeting is headed by 14 Corps Commander Lt Gen Harinder Singh, while the Chinese side was to be led by the Commander of the Tibet Military District Major General Liu Lin. Following the Galwan Valley incident, the government has given the armed forces ""full freedom"" to give a ""befitting"" response to any Chinese misadventure along the LAC, the 3,500-km de-facto border. The Army has sent thousands of additional troops to forward locations along the border in the last two weeks. The IAF has also moved air defence systems as well as a sizeable number of its frontline combat jets and attack helicopters to several key air bases. The first round of the Lt General talks were held on June 6 during which both sides finalised an agreement to disengage gradually from all the standoff points beginning with Galwan Valley. However, the situation deteriorated following the Galwan Valley clash as the two sides significantly bolstered their deployments in most areas along the LAC. The situation in eastern Ladakh deteriorated after around 250 Chinese and Indian soldiers were engaged in a violent face-off on May 5 and 6. The incident in Pangong Tso was followed by a similar incident in north Sikkim on May 9. ",

The move against the “malicious Apps”, announced by the information technology ministry, came after several complaints of stealing of user data, which was allegedly being surreptitiously transmitted to servers located outside India, the government said, without naming China. LAC - standoff live updatesSeparately, the Indian Cyber Crime Coordination Centre in the home ministry also recommended that the Apps should be blocked. TikTok removed from Apple, Google stores“This move will safeguard the interests of crores of Indian mobile and internet users. This decision is a targeted move to ensure safety and sovereignty of Indian cyberspace,” the government said. Sources added that the decision will pinch as it will affect millions of dollars of revenue. The decision to block the Apps was not a complete surprise as there had been widespread speculation that there can be regulatory action against Chinese Apps, with several of them accused of transferring user data to servers in China. “Modi government has shown its resolve and dexterity to engage China on multiple fronts and hit China where it hurts the most. This is India’s first salvo to China after the border clashes, showing that India has a diverse range of retaliatory options,” an official source said. The assessment is that this will significantly erode the valuation of several Chinese companies. Sources say the Indian Cyber Crime Coordination Centre found that data was flowing to China even though some of the entities whose Apps have been blocked were notionally located in the US or other countries such as Singapore. In the case of TikTok and some of the other Apps, investigations revealed that the camera, microphone and full network access were configured in such a way that any data use or espionage could not be verified by the Indian authorities. “With access to people’s cameras and PCs, these Apps heightened the risk of espionage as they could access other devices and servers that may be linked. Already there were concerns about misuse of TikTok for spreading hate or sexual content, including child porn, but what really led to the decision to block was suspicion on espionage,” a source said. The fresh action opens an all-new chapter in the growing tensions between India and China over the Ladakh border, which is gradually spilling over into the world of business, e-commerce and now mobile Apps. “… there have been raging concerns on aspects relating to data security and safeguarding the privacy of 130 crore Indians. It has been noted recently that such concerns also pose a threat to sovereignty and security of our country,” the IT ministry said. The government said it has received representations from various citizens regarding the security of their data and risk to privacy relating to operation of certain Apps. “The Computer Emergency Response Team (CERT-IN) has also received many representations from citizens regarding security of data and breach of privacy… Likewise, there have been similar bipartisan concerns, flagged by various public representatives, both outside and inside the Parliament of India.” In Video:India bans 59 Chinese Apps including TikTok, UC Browser",Pankaj Doval

In address to the nation, the Prime Minister also asked people to be careful against cough and cold in the rainy season. Here is the full text. We are now entering Unlock-Two in our fight against the corona pandemic. We are also entering the season of increasing cases of cough, cold and fever. I, therefore, request all of you to take special care of yourselves Friends, considering corona’s death rate, India is comparatively in a better position compared to many countries of the world. Timely imposition of lockdown and other decisions have saved lakhs of lives. But we have also seen that since Unlock-One, there is increasing negligence in personal and social behaviour. Earlier, we were very careful with respect to wearing of masks, social distancing and washing of hands for 20 seconds. But today, when we need to be more careful, increasing negligence is a cause of worry. Friends, rules were followed very strictly during the Lockdown. Now governments, local bodies, citizens, need to show similar alertness. Especially, we need to focus more on containment zones. Those not following the rules will need to be stopped and cautioned. You must have seen in the news, Prime Minister of a country was fined Rs. 13,000 for not wearing a mask in public place. In India too, the local administration should work with the same enthusiasm. This is a drive to protect the lives of 130 crore countrymen. Be it a village pradhan or the Prime Minister, no one is above the law in India Friends, nation’s top priority during the lockdown was to ensure that no one remains hungry. Central government, state governments, civil society, all did their best... to ensure that no one goes to bed hungry. Be it a nation or a person, timely and sensible decisions increase our power to fight any crisis. Thus, immediately after the lockdown, the government brought out the Pradhan Mantri Garib Kalyan Yojana. Under this scheme, a package worth Rs. 1.75 lakh crore was provided for the poor. Friends, in the last three months, 20 Crore poor households have received direct benefit transfers worth Rs. 31,000 Crore. During this period, Rs. 18,000 crore have been deposited in bank accounts of over 9 Crore farmers. Simultaneously, Pradhan Mantri Garib Kalyan Rojgar Abhiyaan was quickly launched for employment of Shramiks in rural areasGovernment is spending Rs. 50,000 Crore on this. Friends, there is another big thing that has surprised the whole world. In India, over 80 crore people were given free ration for three months. It means, every member of the family was given 5 kilogram wheat or rice, free of cost. In addition, every family got one kilogram pulse per month, free of cost. In a way, over 2.5 times the population of the United States, 12 times the population of the United Kingdom and double the population of the European Union was given free ration by our government. Friends, today, I am making a big announcement related to this. Friends, in our country, there are many activities in agriculture during and after rainy season. Other sectors do not have much activity. July also marks beginning of the festive season. 5th July is Guru Purnima, then month of Saawan is starting. Then 15th August is coming, Raksha Bandhan, Sri Krishna Janmashtami,Ganesh Chaturthi, Onam will follow. Further, Kati Bihu, Navratri, Durga Puja is coming, then Dussera, Diwali and Chhath. This festive season increases necessities as well as expenditure. Keeping all these things in mind, it has been decided to extend Pradhan Mantri Garib Kalyan Anna Yojana up to Diwali and Chhath Puja, till November-end. It means, this scheme giving free ration to 80 crore people will continue in July, August, September, October, November. Government will provide free ration to 80 crore poor brothers-sisters for five months. Every member of family will get five kilogram wheat or rice. Also, every family will get one kilogram whole chana per month, free of cost. Friends, over 90 thousand crore rupees will be spent on this extension of PM Garib Kalyan Anna Yojana. If we add expenditure of last three months on this scheme, then it comes to around 1.5 lakh crore rupees. We have seen a dream for the whole country and some states have really done well. We are requesting other states also to take it forward. And, what is that?Now, One Nation, One Ration card is also being implemented. Major beneficiaries of this will be those who go to other states, in search of employment. Friends, today, if the government is able to provide free ration to the needy and poor, then credit for it goes to two categories. One – hard working farmers of our country. Second – honest taxpayers of our country. It is your hard work and dedication, due to which the nation is able to do it. You have filled the stocks of the nation, therefore, there is food in kitchen of poor, workers.You paid the tax honestly, you fulfilled your duty. That is why, the poor of the country is successfully coping with such a big crisis. On behalf of all the poor of the country, I express my heartfelt gratitude to all the taxpayers and farmers, and also salute them. riends! In the coming days, we will further strengthen our efforts and continuously work to empower the poor, downtrodden and deprived sections of society. While taking all the precautions, we will further expand the Economic Activities. We will work ceaselessly for Atmanirbhar Bharat. We all will be vocal for Local. With this pledge and commitment, the 130 crore people of this country will have to work together and move forward together. I once again request you, pray for your, and appeal to you, that you all remain healthy, maintain a distance of two yards, always use your ‘Gamchha’, Face cover and mask. Please, do not be careless.

Now, it appears that the company has started doing that for the beta users of its app. As per a report by WABetaInfo, the website that tracks the upcoming changes and features on the instant messaging platform, both Android and iOS beta users can now download ‘Playful Piyomaru’ — the first animated sticker pack — from WhatsApp Store. The report claims that the support for downloading animated sticker packs has been rolled out for the users of 2.20.195.1 Android beta and 2.20.70.26 iOS beta versions or newer versions. To recall, in its previous report, WABetaInfo claimed that animated stickers feature on WhatsApp will include three aspects to its functionality. The first is to be able to view them, which comes with the option to save and send them as well; the second is to be able to import them from third-party sources and lastly to be able to download them from the official WhatsApp Store, that would be currently implemented in the app. While the first part of the feature was enabled last week only, today the beta users of the instant messaging app have got the support for the third part. At the time of filing this report, there appears to be only one sticker pack available officially on WhatsApp Store, however, more animated stickers packs should follow soon. Readers must note that, just as it was last time, there is still no support for looping of these animated stickers on the app as of now and there is no word if WhatsApp is going to allow looping or include a toggle to enable it.

The curbs on the cards include restricted entry into districts where cases are on the rise, temporary closure of major public parks, wholesale markets and temples for at least two weeks to avoid congregation of people. After a meeting with officers, revenue minister R Ashoka said the government will reimpose curbs only after July 7 so that SSLC students, writing ongoing exams, aren’t disturbed by the new measures. He said chief minister BS Yediyurappa will hold a meeting after July 4 and decide on the possible curbs. More tests have led to surge in cases: AshokaThe minister, quoting experts, said the cases were likely to further increase in July and August. The biggest task before the government, according to Ashoka, is to ramp up the bed infrastructure with more samples testing positive by the day. “We are taking steps to add 8,000 beds immediately — 5,000 of them at Bengaluru Exhibition Centre on Tumakuru Road, 1,000 each at Bangalore University and the agriculture university, 250 at Koramangala stadium, 300 at government ayurvedic college hostels, 432 at Haj Bhavan and 176 beds at the Art of Living on Kanakapura Road,’’ he added. Indicating more tests have led to a surge in cases, Ashoka said private testing centres would, until now, directly inform patients about test results. “Now, we have issued a directive asking them to upload test results only on BBMP and ICMR portals and the authorities, in turn, will inform the patients along with the treatment roadmap,” he said. This, the minister said, is to ensure patients do not panic and rush to hospitals. “Before they could do so, wardlevel health officers will meet the patient, check whether he or she is symptomatic or not. If symptomatic, he or she will be sent to a designated hospital; if asymptomatic, he or she will be taken to a Covid Care Centre,” he said. ",Anil Gejji

Apps like Zoom might have lost their novelty factor but with more people getting used to them, it’s time for competition to outdo each other. Google, as per an online report, is working on a number of features for Meet, its video-conferencing application. According to a report by 9to5Google, the Mountain View-based tech giant is working on a feature that will let users blur backgrounds or replace them completely. Users will have a lot of default options or they can choose their own preferred backgrounds. The report states that admins on group meetings will have the option to disable the particular feature. The idea behind the feature is to let others not see certain surroundings which one may not want to show. The feature is also directed at making students and teachers more comfortable while attending meetings or classes on Meet. While the exact date of the new feature is not known, it is expected to be rolled out in the coming months. The custom background feature isn’t the only one that Google is planning to bring to Meet. The report says that a hand raising feature that will make conversations easier by allowing participants to virtually raise their hands is also expected to arrive. Another feature that is expected is Meeting attendance, which will give an idea to the host to know who participated in the meeting. A new Q&A feature is also rumoured to be in the works and it will allow users to ask questions without interrupting an ongoing meeting or conversation. Google is also expected to give meeting hosts more controls like giving the option of muting someone as well. Some of these features are already available on Google Meet’s rivals like Zoom and Microsoft Teams. ",
