The 55-year-old minister has been diagnosed with pneumonia and his oxygen saturation level has also dipped, prompting hospital authorities to shift him to an intensive care unit. "He was brought to Max hospital in the evening and admitted in ICU," a source said. Jain had tested positive for Covid-19 on Wednesday, a day after he was admitted to RGSSH, a dedicated Covid-19 facility, after running high-grade fever and suffering sudden drop in oxygen levels. Jain was admitted to the Rajiv Gandhi Super Speciality Hospital (RGSSH), a dedicated COVID-19 facility under the city government in east Delhi, on June 16. According to doctors treating him, Jain was kept full-time on oxygen support as his oxygen saturation level (Spo2) had dipped. "We have put him fully on oxygen support as his Spo2 level had fallen to 89 at one point, normal level is about 95. Also, he has been diagnosed with pneumonia, so we decided to shift him to an ICU at the hospital," a senior official of the hospital told PTI earlier in the day. However, later it was decided to send him directly to the Max Hospital, he said. Jain had tested positive for Covid-19 on Wednesday, a day after he was admitted to RGSSH after running high-grade fever and suffering sudden drop in oxygen levels. Jain was brought to the RGSSH in the early hours of Tuesday and was administered a test for novel coronavirus infection that morning, for which he had tested negative. His test was repeated on Wednesday as he still had fever and showed symptoms of the infection. The second test result came out positive. Sources in the Delhi government had on Wednesday said people who interacted with him in the days before his hospitalisation would be quarantined as per the advice of doctors. On Sunday, Jain attended a high-level meeting on the coronavirus situation in the national capital, chaired by Union home minister Amit Shah, which was also attended by Delhi Lt Governor Anil Baijal, Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal, deputy chief minister Manish Sisodia and Union health minister Harsh Vardhan.

Rules notified under the Delhi Epidemic Diseases Regulations state that there is now complete prohibition on consumption of pan, gutka, tobacco etc. in public areas. Moreover, the powers to issue fines have also been entrusted to junior officials. An order issued by the deputy commissioners of the municipal corporations states that offences under five categories of violations will invite a fine of Rs 500 for the first offence and Rs 1,000 in case of repeated violations. The three civic bodies have issued more than 2,500 spitting fines till last week. A South Delhi Municipal Corporation official said that a more sustained campaign will be run soon to cause behavioural change in public and these penalties are intended to create a deterrent effect. Besides the consumption of pan, gutka etc. in public places, the five offences as per the directives of Delhi Disaster Management Authority include non-observation of quarantine rules, not maintaining social distancing, not wearing face cover in public places or workplaces and violation of prohibition on spitting in public places. Civic bodies have also devolved the powers to impose fines and even school principals, assistant sanitation inspectors, veterinary services officials, assistant malaria inspectors, public health inspectors, sanitary inspectors and junior engineers, among others, have been empowered to issue fines under these five categories of Covid-related offences. “In case any person fails to pay the penalty on spot action under Section 188 of IPC will be taken against him by police on receipt of complaint from these authorised persons,” the official explained. The personnel authorised to issue challans have also been provided a protection as per the Epidemic Act. A notification issued by the deputy secretary of health and family welfare department states that “no legal proceedings shall lie against authorised persons for anything done in good faith for ensuring stricter compliance.” Read this story in Bengali', 'author': 'Paras Singh'}

He was escorted by health department employees in PPE kits and the MLA was also in a white PPE suit covered from head to toe and carried only his mobile phone. He reached the assembly before 1pm and was escorted to the voting station when all other MLAs had left. Election officials stood at a safe distance away from him as he cast the final vote. Speaking to TOI, he said, "I reached the state assembly in a PPE kit suit. I travelled in an ambulance escorted by officials who were also in PPE kits. I voted for my party candidate and returned home." BJP spokesmen Hitesh Vajpayee and Lokendra Parashar objected to the Covid-19 posotive Congress MLA casting his vote for Rajya Sabha polls. But returning officer AP Singh said all necessary precautions had been taken and he became the last to vote because of his health condition. ', 'author': 'Suchandana Gupta'}

The tree’s fruit is not only tasty, but also has many medicinal values. IMG Sanstha of Gurugram has ordered its seeds from a farmer in Jaisalmer and will be sown in many parks in Delhi. This Sanstha has developed a nursery at Aravalli Diversity Park in which there are more than 150 varieties considered important from Aravalli and Thar landscape. Salvadora, which is locally known as peelu or Rajasthani angoor is on bloom in desert area. A team of scientists from New Delhi had come to Jaisalmer and after research they went to Sanvta village and requested farmer Sumer Singh Bhati to send the seeds to IMG Sanstha Gurugram. Bhati said the dried fruits were sent to the sanstha through courier and will be grown in their nursery after which the saplings will be planted at many parks, adding that there is now demand for the seeds from many places, including Lucknow. Sanstha’s Dr Vijay Dasmana said he works on eco-restoration project in the entire country and this fruit is called salvadora. He got information about this fruit from farmers of Jaisalmer and he has ordered the seeds. This fruit is an important variety with regard to Aravalli and Thar landscape. The seeds will be sown in the nursery and later the saplings will be planted in various parks. Another SBK College scientist Professor Shyamsunder Meena said it is a leading variety of desert. Generally all trees and plants dry up during drought and severe heat, but this tree remains green and gives fruit, which fulfills the need of water and other necessary elements. It has vitamin C and carbohydrates in abundance. Meena said its green shoots and leaves are being used by people over 3,000 years as toothbrush and mouth freshner. Apart from this, its fruit, leaves, flowers and other parts are used as traditional medicine. ', 'author': 'Vimal Bhatia'}

The number of such labs will keep increasing, he said. Addressing Shiv Sena leaders and office-bearers online on the occasion of the party\'s 54th anniversary, Thackeray said that doctors were being provided all the required equipment like masks, PPE kits and hand gloves as they combat the disease. He also informed the party workers that he would take part in the all-party meeting with Prime Minister Narendra Modi to discuss the Galwan Valley clash. "The Sahyadri (Maharashtra) will be with the Himalaya during the crisis hour," he said. Twenty Indian Army personnel, including a colonel, were killed in a fierce clash with the Chinese troops in the Galwan Valley in eastern Ladakh on Monday night. Thackeray said his contact with the partymen might have become less frequent after he became the chief minister, but he would never distance himself from them. Stating that Shiv Sena was born to fight injustice, Thackeray said he would carry forward the legacy of his late father and party founder Bal Thackeray. He said the Shiv Sena shakhas (branches) in the city will be turned into temporary clinics to treat patients. He also praised the party workers, saying that they are never afraid of any crisis and work for the people by putting everything else aside. "Let there be any storm or any cyclone or any other crisis. I am not afraid of anything till the Shiv Sainiks (workers) like you are with me," Thackeray said. Maharashtra minister and Shiv Sena leader Aaditya Thackeray also spoke on the occasion and pitched for expanding the party\'s base in each of the country\'s states. ', 'author': ''}

Basava Jaya Mrutyunjaya Swamiji of Lingayat Panchamasali Peetha Kudala Sangam said Sumbad, a farmer, came forward to donate his land adjacent to the state highway when local authorities failed to provide land for the memorial. "The committee led by Basava Jaya Mrutyunjaya Swamiji sought a 15x10 plot but when I went through their plan of constructing a model of Kittur fort, I decided to donate 425 sq ft," said the 61-year-old farmer. "Rani Chennamma is the pride of every Indian, irrespective of caste and creed, and my contribution is nothing compared to her sacrifice for the nation."  Sumbad, who lives in the neighbouring town of Almel, said he is a man of modest means but proud to make the contribution. "I own nine acres of land in Almel. I have six sons and two daughters. Two of my sons run small businesses in Mumbai. Ten of us live in a small house in Almel," he said. Kin happy to donate land for memorial, says farmerI also work as a broker to sell or buy sites. I had bought 15 guntas of land in Sindagi for my children some 15 years ago. When our MLA MC Managuli and Swamiji sought land for the memorial, my entire family agreed wholeheartedly” Sumbad said. “As Chennamma’s history is linked to Sindagi, there has been a demand for a memorial here since 2008, but the town municipal council failed to provide land due to political and technical reasons,” said Swamiji. “There were plans to observe a Sindagi bandh in the first week of June to protest the indifference of authorities. But then Sumbad gave us his land. We have formed a committee to construct a model of Kittur fort and a bronze statue of Chennamma at a cost of Rs 28 lakh.” Sindagi made headlines recently after some anti-social elements hoisted a Pakistan flag to stoke tension. The prime accused in the Gauri Lankesh killing is also from this town. Shivakumar Uppin, a resident of Almel, said Hindus and Muslims have lived in harmony here for centuries. “Sumbad’s donation has strengthened this bond further,” he said.

Sources said the move was first in the region and the civic body was preparing a detailed case study to submit to the ministry of housing and urban affairs, so that it could be replicated in other parts of the country as well. The three transgender licencees are Shrishti, Mona and Vijayta, who were making a living by selling tea in Industrial Area. Sources said during the street vendors’ survey, they were left out due to some reasons, so later they filed a representation with the street vendors’ cell, which considered their request. “Their proposal was scrutinised by the vendors’ cell and tabled in the 26th meeting of the town vending committee and approved by the chairperson. Three of them were called along with the head of the community, Kajal Mukhi, on Tuesday for registration. They were told about various other schemes, self-help groups, self-entrepreneurship programmes, among others. The cell is committed to work towards mainstreaming and sensitisation of the transgenders through their community organisers,” said Vivek Trivedi, social development officer of the MC.

Reaffirming their faith in getting successful in seemingly mission impossible on World Crocodile Day, the team asserted: “We will keep making efforts to rescue it even if it takes some more days!” For, the group of 15 youngsters, including a few mountaineers, has been waging a war against time for 80 long hours till Wednesday to rescue the crocodile that fell into the well in a village of Waghodia taluka four days ago on Sunday. The youths would take turns to climb up and down the well in their attempts to get hold of the reptile, but it seems to be contented living in the confined space feasting on toads inside the well and evading ‘arrest’. “A few villagers who saw the reptile crawling towards the well and slipping inside it immediately informed us. Our team rushed to Narshipura village and began rescue operations, which in itself has proved to a most daunting expedition,” said Hemant Vadhwana, animal activist who is leading the group. The reptile ventured out of a canal about two kilometres away, he added. On the first day, the group dropped an automatic cage inside the well hoping that the reptile will crawl inside. But it failed. Then Hemant decided to climb down the well with the help of a rope. “We first emptied some water from the well so that I could go down and catch the crocodile. But it kept slipping away as the surface is full of garbage and even has thorny plants,” the 22-year-old activist told TOI. “It can survive inside the well but it will forever be at the risk of being suffocated owing to the garbage dumped in the well by the villagers,” said Ketan Raval, another team member, who added that they hope to catch it soon.
